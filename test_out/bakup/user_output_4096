line = 14 | 1 | Vienna early next morning; should have arrived at 6:46, but train was an
line = 15 | 1 | hour late. Buda-Pesth seems a wonderful place, from the glimpse which I
line = 16 | 1 | got of it from the train and the little I could walk through the
line = 17 | 1 | streets. I feared to go very far from the station, as we had arrived
line = 18 | 1 | late and would start as near the correct time as possible. The
line = 19 | 1 | impression I had was that we were leaving the West and entering the
line = 20 | 1 | East; the most western of splendid bridges over the Danube, which is
line = 21 | 1 | here of noble width and depth, took us among the traditions of Turkish
line = 22 | 1 | rule.
line = 23 | 1 | 
line = 24 | 1 | We left in pretty good time, and came after nightfall to Klausenburgh.
line = 25 | 1 | Here I stopped for the night at the Hotel Royale. I had for dinner, or
line = 26 | 1 | rather supper, a chicken done up some way with red pepper, which was
line = 27 | 1 | very good but thirsty. (_Mem._, get recipe for Mina.) I asked the
line = 28 | 1 | waiter, and he said it was called "paprika hendl," and that, as it was a
line = 29 | 1 | national dish, I should be able to get it anywhere along the
line = 30 | 1 | Carpathians. I found my smattering of German very useful here; indeed, I
line = 31 | 1 | don't know how I should be able to get on without it.
line = 32 | 1 | 
line = 33 | 1 | Having had some time at my disposal when in London, I had visited the
line = 34 | 1 | British Museum, and made search among the books and maps in the library
line = 35 | 1 | regarding Transylvania; it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the
line = 36 | 1 | country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a
line = 37 | 1 | nobleman of that country. I find that the district he named is in the
line = 38 | 1 | extreme east of the country, just on the borders of three states,
line = 39 | 1 | Transylvania, Moldavia and Bukovina, in the midst of the Carpathian
line = 40 | 1 | mountains; one of the wildest and least known portions of Europe. I was
line = 41 | 1 | not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the
line = 42 | 1 | Castle Dracula, as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare
line = 43 | 1 | with our own Ordnance Survey maps; but I found that Bistritz, the post
line = 44 | 1 | town named by Count Dracula, is a fairly well-known place. I shall enter
line = 45 | 1 | here some of my notes, as they may refresh my memory when I talk over my
line = 46 | 1 | travels with Mina.
line = 47 | 1 | 
line = 48 | 1 | In the population of Transylvania there are four distinct nationalities:
line = 49 | 1 | Saxons in the South, and mixed with them the Wallachs, who are the
line = 50 | 1 | descendants of the Dacians; Magyars in the West, and Szekelys in the
line = 51 | 1 | East and North. I am going among the latter, who claim to be descended
line = 52 | 1 | from Attila and the Huns. This may be so, for when the Magyars conquered
line = 53 | 1 | the country in the eleventh century they found the Huns settled in it. I
line = 54 | 1 | read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the
line = 55 | 1 | horseshoe of the Carpathians, as if it were the centre of some sort of
line = 56 | 1 | imaginative whirlpool; if so my stay may be very interesting. (_Mem._, I
line = 57 | 1 | must ask the Count all about them.)
line = 58 | 1 | 
line = 59 | 1 | I did not sleep well, though my bed was comfortable enough, for I had
line = 60 | 1 | all sorts of queer dreams. There was a dog howling all night under my
line = 61 | 1 | window, which may have had something to do with it; or it may have been
line = 62 | 1 | the paprika, for I had to drink up all the water in my carafe, and was
line = 63 | 1 | still thirsty. Towards morning I slept and was wakened by the continuous
line = 64 | 1 | knocking at my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
line = 65 | 1 | I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour
line = 66 | 1 | which they said was "mamaliga," and egg-plant stuffed with forcemeat, a
line = 67 | 1 | very excellent dish, which they call "impletata." (_Mem._, get recipe
line = 68 | 1 | for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started a little
line = 69 | 1 | before eight, or rather it ought to have done so, for after rushing to
line = 70 | 1 | the station at 7:30 I had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour
line = 71 | 1 | before we began to move. It seems to me that the further east you go the
line = 72 | 1 | more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?
line = 73 | 1 | 
line = 74 | 1 | All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
line = 75 | 1 | beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the
line = 76 | 1 | top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
line = 77 | 1 | rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
line = 78 | 1 | of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
line = 79 | 1 | running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
line = 80 | 1 | station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
line = 81 | 1 | of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
line = 82 | 1 | saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
line = 83 | 1 | and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
line = 84 | 1 | looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
line = 85 | 1 | about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
line = 86 | 1 | and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
line = 87 | 1 | fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
line = 88 | 1 | were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
line = 89 | 1 | Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
line = 90 | 1 | hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
line = 91 | 1 | heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
line = 92 | 1 | nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
line = 93 | 1 | had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
line = 94 | 1 | picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
line = 95 | 1 | set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,
line = 96 | 1 | however, I am told, very harmless and rather wanting in natural
line = 97 | 1 | self-assertion.
line = 98 | 1 | 
line = 99 | 1 | It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
line = 100 | 1 | very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
line = 101 | 1 | Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
line = 102 | 1 | existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
line = 103 | 1 | of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
line = 104 | 1 | occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
line = 105 | 1 | a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
line = 106 | 1 | proper being assisted by famine and disease.
line = 107 | 1 | 
line = 108 | 1 | Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
line = 109 | 1 | found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
line = 110 | 1 | course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
line = 111 | 1 | evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
line = 112 | 1 | cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
line = 113 | 1 | undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
line = 114 | 1 | fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
line = 115 | 1 | said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She
line = 116 | 1 | smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
line = 117 | 1 | who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
line = 118 | 1 | a letter:--
line = 119 | 1 | 
line = 120 | 1 |      "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
line = 121 | 1 |      you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
line = 122 | 1 |      start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
line = 123 | 1 |      Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
line = 124 | 1 |      that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
line = 125 | 1 |      will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
line = 126 | 1 | 
line = 127 | 1 | "Your friend,

line = 129 | 1 | "DRACULA."
line = 130 | 1 | 
line = 131 | 1 | 
line = 132 | 1 | _4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
line = 133 | 1 | directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
line = 134 | 1 | making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
line = 135 | 1 | pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
line = 136 | 1 | true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
line = 137 | 1 | answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
line = 138 | 1 | lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
line = 139 | 1 | way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
line = 140 | 1 | was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
line = 141 | 1 | tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
line = 142 | 1 | and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
line = 143 | 1 | further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
line = 144 | 1 | any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
line = 145 | 1 | comforting.
line = 146 | 1 | 
line = 147 | 1 | Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
line = 148 | 1 | very hysterical way:
line = 149 | 1 | 
line = 150 | 1 | "Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited
line = 151 | 1 | state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
line = 152 | 1 | mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
line = 153 | 1 | was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
line = 154 | 1 | that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
line = 155 | 1 | she asked again:
line = 156 | 1 | 
line = 157 | 1 | "Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May.
line = 158 | 1 | She shook her head as she said again:
line = 159 | 1 | 
line = 160 | 1 | "Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On
line = 161 | 1 | my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
line = 162 | 1 | 
line = 163 | 1 | "It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
line = 164 | 1 | the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
line = 165 | 1 | full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"
line = 166 | 1 | She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
line = 167 | 1 | without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
line = 168 | 1 | to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
line = 169 | 1 | ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
line = 170 | 1 | to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
line = 171 | 1 | tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
line = 172 | 1 | her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
line = 173 | 1 | dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
line = 174 | 1 | did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
line = 175 | 1 | taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
line = 176 | 1 | seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
line = 177 | 1 | state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
line = 178 | 1 | rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out
line = 179 | 1 | of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
line = 180 | 1 | for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
line = 181 | 1 | round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
line = 182 | 1 | traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
line = 183 | 1 | am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
line = 184 | 1 | ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
line = 185 | 1 | coach!
line = 186 | 1 |
