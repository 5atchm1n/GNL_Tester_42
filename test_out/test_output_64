line = 65 | 1 | I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour

line = 73 | 1 | 
line = 74 | 1 | All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
line = 75 | 1 | beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the

line = 77 | 1 | rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
line = 78 | 1 | of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
line = 79 | 1 | running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
line = 80 | 1 | station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
line = 81 | 1 | of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
line = 82 | 1 | saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
line = 83 | 1 | and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
line = 84 | 1 | looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
line = 85 | 1 | about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
line = 86 | 1 | and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
line = 87 | 1 | fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
line = 88 | 1 | were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
line = 89 | 1 | Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
line = 90 | 1 | hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
line = 91 | 1 | heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
line = 92 | 1 | nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
line = 93 | 1 | had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
line = 94 | 1 | picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
line = 95 | 1 | set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,

line = 98 | 1 | 
line = 99 | 1 | It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
line = 100 | 1 | very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
line = 101 | 1 | Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
line = 102 | 1 | existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
line = 103 | 1 | of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
line = 104 | 1 | occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
line = 105 | 1 | a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
line = 106 | 1 | proper being assisted by famine and disease.
line = 107 | 1 | 
line = 108 | 1 | Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
line = 109 | 1 | found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
line = 110 | 1 | course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
line = 111 | 1 | evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
line = 112 | 1 | cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
line = 113 | 1 | undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
line = 114 | 1 | fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
line = 115 | 1 | said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She
line = 116 | 1 | smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
line = 117 | 1 | who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
line = 118 | 1 | a letter:--
line = 119 | 1 | 
line = 120 | 1 |      "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
line = 121 | 1 |      you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
line = 122 | 1 |      start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
line = 123 | 1 |      Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
line = 124 | 1 |      that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
line = 125 | 1 |      will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.

line = 132 | 1 | _4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
line = 133 | 1 | directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
line = 134 | 1 | making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
line = 135 | 1 | pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
line = 136 | 1 | true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
line = 137 | 1 | answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
line = 138 | 1 | lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
line = 139 | 1 | way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
line = 140 | 1 | was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
line = 141 | 1 | tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
line = 142 | 1 | and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
line = 143 | 1 | further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
line = 144 | 1 | any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
line = 145 | 1 | comforting.
line = 146 | 1 | 
line = 147 | 1 | Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
line = 148 | 1 | very hysterical way:
line = 149 | 1 | 
line = 150 | 1 | "Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited
line = 151 | 1 | state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
line = 152 | 1 | mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
line = 153 | 1 | was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
line = 154 | 1 | that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
line = 155 | 1 | she asked again:
line = 156 | 1 | 
line = 157 | 1 | "Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May.
line = 158 | 1 | She shook her head as she said again:
line = 159 | 1 | 
line = 160 | 1 | "Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On
line = 161 | 1 | my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
line = 162 | 1 | 
line = 163 | 1 | "It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
line = 164 | 1 | the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
line = 165 | 1 | full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"
line = 166 | 1 | She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
line = 167 | 1 | without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
line = 168 | 1 | to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
line = 169 | 1 | ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
line = 170 | 1 | to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
line = 171 | 1 | tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
line = 172 | 1 | her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
line = 173 | 1 | dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
line = 174 | 1 | did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
line = 175 | 1 | taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
line = 176 | 1 | seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
line = 177 | 1 | state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
line = 178 | 1 | rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out
line = 179 | 1 | of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
line = 180 | 1 | for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
line = 181 | 1 | round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
line = 182 | 1 | traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
line = 183 | 1 | am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
line = 184 | 1 | ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
line = 185 | 1 | coach!

line = 100 | 1 | very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
line = 101 | 1 | Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
line = 102 | 1 | existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
line = 103 | 1 | of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
line = 104 | 1 | occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
line = 105 | 1 | a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
line = 106 | 1 | proper being assisted by famine and disease.
line = 107 | 1 | 
line = 108 | 1 | Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
line = 109 | 1 | found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
line = 110 | 1 | course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
line = 111 | 1 | evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
line = 112 | 1 | cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
line = 113 | 1 | undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
line = 114 | 1 | fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
line = 115 | 1 | said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She
line = 116 | 1 | smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
line = 117 | 1 | who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
line = 118 | 1 | a letter:--
line = 119 | 1 | 
line = 120 | 1 |      "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
line = 121 | 1 |      you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
line = 122 | 1 |      start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
line = 123 | 1 |      Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
line = 124 | 1 |      that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
line = 125 | 1 |      will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
line = 126 | 1 | 
line = 127 | 1 | "Your friend,
line = 128 | 1 | 
line = 129 | 1 | "DRACULA."
line = 130 | 1 | 
line = 131 | 1 | 
line = 132 | 1 | _4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
line = 133 | 1 | directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
line = 134 | 1 | making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
line = 135 | 1 | pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
line = 136 | 1 | true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
line = 137 | 1 | answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
line = 138 | 1 | lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
line = 139 | 1 | way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
line = 140 | 1 | was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
line = 141 | 1 | tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
line = 142 | 1 | and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
line = 143 | 1 | further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
line = 144 | 1 | any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
line = 145 | 1 | comforting.
line = 146 | 1 | 
line = 147 | 1 | Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
line = 148 | 1 | very hysterical way:
line = 149 | 1 | 
line = 150 | 1 | "Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited
line = 151 | 1 | state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
line = 152 | 1 | mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
line = 153 | 1 | was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
line = 154 | 1 | that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
line = 155 | 1 | she asked again:
line = 156 | 1 | 
line = 157 | 1 | "Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May.
line = 158 | 1 | She shook her head as she said again:
line = 159 | 1 | 
line = 160 | 1 | "Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On
line = 161 | 1 | my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
line = 162 | 1 | 
line = 163 | 1 | "It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
line = 164 | 1 | the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
line = 165 | 1 | full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"
line = 166 | 1 | She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
line = 167 | 1 | without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
line = 168 | 1 | to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
line = 169 | 1 | ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
line = 170 | 1 | to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
line = 171 | 1 | tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
line = 172 | 1 | her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
line = 173 | 1 | dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
line = 174 | 1 | did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
line = 175 | 1 | taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
line = 176 | 1 | seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
line = 177 | 1 | state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
line = 178 | 1 | rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out
line = 179 | 1 | of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
line = 180 | 1 | for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
line = 181 | 1 | round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
line = 182 | 1 | traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
line = 183 | 1 | am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
line = 184 | 1 | ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
line = 185 | 1 | coach!
line = 186 | 1 | 
line = 187 | 1 |        *       *       *       *       *
line = 188 | 1 | 
line = 189 | 1 | _5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
line = 190 | 1 | high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or
line = 191 | 1 | hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are
line = 192 | 1 | mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,
line = 193 | 1 | naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put
line = 194 | 1 | down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I
line = 195 | 1 | left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they
line = 196 | 1 | called "robber steak"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
line = 197 | 1 | pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
line = 198 | 1 | style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which
line = 199 | 1 | produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
line = 200 | 1 | disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.
line = 201 | 1 | 
line = 202 | 1 | When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him
line = 203 | 1 | talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every
line = 204 | 1 | now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting
line = 205 | 1 | on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning
line = 206 | 1 | "word-bearer"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
line = 207 | 1 | pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
line = 208 | 1 | there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot
line = 209 | 1 | dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not
line = 210 | 1 | cheering to me, for amongst them were "Ordog"--Satan, "pokol"--hell,
line = 211 | 1 | "stregoica"--witch, "vrolok" and "vlkoslak"--both of which mean the same
line = 212 | 1 | thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is
line = 213 | 1 | either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these
line = 214 | 1 | superstitions)
line = 215 | 1 | 
line = 216 | 1 | When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
line = 217 | 1 | swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
line = 218 | 1 | pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a
line = 219 | 1 | fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at
line = 220 | 1 | first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a
line = 221 | 1 | charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,
line = 222 | 1 | just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one
line = 223 | 1 | seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
line = 224 | 1 | could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I
line = 225 | 1 | had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
line = 226 | 1 | themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of
line = 227 | 1 | rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
line = 228 | 1 | centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
line = 229 | 1 | the whole front of the box-seat--"gotza" they call them--cracked his big
line = 230 | 1 | whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
line = 231 | 1 | our journey.
line = 232 | 1 | 
line = 233 | 1 | I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
line = 234 | 1 | scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather
line = 235 | 1 | languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have
line = 236 | 1 | been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping
line = 237 | 1 | land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned
line = 238 | 1 | with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the
line = 239 | 1 | road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,
line = 240 | 1 | plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under
line = 241 | 1 | the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these
line = 242 | 1 | green hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the road,
line = 243 | 1 | losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the
line = 244 | 1 | straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
line = 245 | 1 | hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we
line = 246 | 1 | seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then
line = 247 | 1 | what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
line = 248 | 1 | time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime
line = 249 | 1 | excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
line = 250 | 1 | snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
line = 251 | 1 | the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
line = 252 | 1 | in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the
line = 253 | 1 | Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,
line = 254 | 1 | and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.
line = 255 | 1 | 
line = 256 | 1 | Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes
line = 257 | 1 | of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right
line = 258 | 1 | and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
line = 259 | 1 | them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
line = 260 | 1 | deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
line = 261 | 1 | grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
line = 262 | 1 | pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
line = 263 | 1 | the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
line = 264 | 1 | mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again
line = 265 | 1 | the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as
line = 266 | 1 | we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered
line = 267 | 1 | peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to
line = 268 | 1 | be right before us:--
line = 269 | 1 | 
line = 270 | 1 | "Look! Isten szek!"--"God's seat!"--and he crossed himself reverently.
line = 271 | 1 | 
line = 272 | 1 | As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
line = 273 | 1 | us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was
line = 274 | 1 | emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
line = 275 | 1 | sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there
line = 276 | 1 | we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed
line = 277 | 1 | that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,
line = 278 | 1 | and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there
line = 279 | 1 | was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even
line = 280 | 1 | turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of
line = 281 | 1 | devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were
line = 282 | 1 | many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here
line = 283 | 1 | and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems
line = 284 | 1 | shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and
line = 285 | 1 | again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its
line = 286 | 1 | long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
line = 287 | 1 | road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming
line = 288 | 1 | peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their
line = 289 | 1 | coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
line = 290 | 1 | staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,
line = 291 | 1 | and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
line = 292 | 1 | gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
line = 293 | 1 | ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
line = 294 | 1 | Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
line = 295 | 1 | late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
line = 296 | 1 | that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
line = 297 | 1 | greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
line = 298 | 1 | peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
line = 299 | 1 | grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
line = 300 | 1 | threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
line = 301 | 1 | Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the
line = 302 | 1 | hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could
line = 303 | 1 | only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,
line = 304 | 1 | but the driver would not hear of it. "No, no," he said; "you must not
line = 305 | 1 | walk here; the dogs are too fierce"; and then he added, with what he
line = 306 | 1 | evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the
line = 307 | 1 | approving smile of the rest--"and you may have enough of such matters
line = 308 | 1 | before you go to sleep." The only stop he would make was a moment's
line = 309 | 1 | pause to light his lamps.
line = 310 | 1 | 
line = 311 | 1 | When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
line = 312 | 1 | passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
line = 313 | 1 | though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully
line = 314 | 1 | with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
line = 315 | 1 | to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of
line = 316 | 1 | patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the
line = 317 | 1 | hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
line = 318 | 1 | rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a
line = 319 | 1 | stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared
line = 320 | 1 | to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
line = 321 | 1 | side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One
line = 322 | 1 | by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed
line = 323 | 1 | upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were
line = 324 | 1 | certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
line = 325 | 1 | faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of
line = 326 | 1 | fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at
line = 327 | 1 | Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
line = 328 | 1 | Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
line = 329 | 1 | passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
line = 330 | 1 | darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either
line = 331 | 1 | happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would
line = 332 | 1 | give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for
line = 333 | 1 | some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
line = 334 | 1 | the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
line = 335 | 1 | air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the
line = 336 | 1 | mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
line = 337 | 1 | into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance
line = 338 | 1 | which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the
line = 339 | 1 | glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light
line = 340 | 1 | was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our
line = 341 | 1 | hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy
line = 342 | 1 | road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.
line = 343 | 1 | The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock
line = 344 | 1 | my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when
line = 345 | 1 | the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I
line = 346 | 1 | could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I
line = 347 | 1 | thought it was "An hour less than the time." Then turning to me, he said
line = 348 | 1 | in German worse than my own:--
line = 349 | 1 | 
line = 350 | 1 | "There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will
line = 351 | 1 | now come on to Bukovina, and return to-morrow or the next day; better
line = 352 | 1 | the next day." Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and
line = 353 | 1 | snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,
line = 354 | 1 | amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
line = 355 | 1 | of themselves, a calèche, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook
line = 356 | 1 | us, and drew up beside the coach. I could see from the flash of our
line = 357 | 1 | lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and
line = 358 | 1 | splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown
line = 359 | 1 | beard and a great black hat, which seemed to hide his face from us. I
line = 360 | 1 | could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
line = 361 | 1 | in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--
line = 362 | 1 | 
line = 363 | 1 | "You are early to-night, my friend." The man stammered in reply:--
line = 364 | 1 | 
line = 365 | 1 | "The English Herr was in a hurry," to which the stranger replied:--
line = 366 | 1 | 
line = 367 | 1 | "That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot
line = 368 | 1 | deceive me, my friend; I know too much, and my horses are swift." As he
line = 369 | 1 | spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with
line = 370 | 1 | very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white as ivory. One of my
line = 371 | 1 | companions whispered to another the line from Burger's "Lenore":--
line = 372 | 1 | 
line = 373 | 1 |     "Denn die Todten reiten schnell"--
line = 374 | 1 |     ("For the dead travel fast.")
line = 375 | 1 | 
line = 376 | 1 | The strange driver evidently heard the words, for he looked up with a
line = 377 | 1 | gleaming smile. The passenger turned his face away, at the same time
line = 378 | 1 | putting out his two fingers and crossing himself. "Give me the Herr's
line = 379 | 1 | luggage," said the driver; and with exceeding alacrity my bags were
line = 380 | 1 | handed out and put in the calèche. Then I descended from the side of the
line = 381 | 1 | coach, as the calèche was close alongside, the driver helping me with a
line = 382 | 1 | hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel; his strength must have been
line = 383 | 1 | prodigious. Without a word he shook his reins, the horses turned, and we
line = 384 | 1 | swept into the darkness of the Pass. As I looked back I saw the steam
line = 385 | 1 | from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps, and projected
line = 386 | 1 | against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves. Then
line = 387 | 1 | the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses, and off they swept
line = 388 | 1 | on their way to Bukovina. As they sank into the darkness I felt a
line = 389 | 1 | strange chill, and a lonely feeling came over me; but a cloak was thrown
line = 390 | 1 | over my shoulders, and a rug across my knees, and the driver said in
line = 391 | 1 | excellent German:--
line = 392 | 1 | 
line = 393 | 1 | "The night is chill, mein Herr, and my master the Count bade me take all
line = 394 | 1 | care of you. There is a flask of slivovitz (the plum brandy of the
line = 395 | 1 | country) underneath the seat, if you should require it." I did not take
line = 396 | 1 | any, but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same. I felt a
line = 397 | 1 | little strangely, and not a little frightened. I think had there been
line = 398 | 1 | any alternative I should have taken it, instead of prosecuting that
line = 399 | 1 | unknown night journey. The carriage went at a hard pace straight along,
line = 400 | 1 | then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road. It
line = 401 | 1 | seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground
line = 402 | 1 | again; and so I took note of some salient point, and found that this was
line = 403 | 1 | so. I would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant, but
line = 404 | 1 | I really feared to do so, for I thought that, placed as I was, any
line = 405 | 1 | protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to
line = 406 | 1 | delay. By-and-by, however, as I was curious to know how time was
line = 407 | 1 | passing, I struck a match, and by its flame looked at my watch; it was
line = 408 | 1 | within a few minutes of midnight. This gave me a sort of shock, for I
line = 409 | 1 | suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my
line = 410 | 1 | recent experiences. I waited with a sick feeling of suspense.
line = 411 | 1 | 
line = 412 | 1 | Then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road--a
line = 413 | 1 | long, agonised wailing, as if from fear. The sound was taken up by
line = 414 | 1 | another dog, and then another and another, till, borne on the wind which
line = 415 | 1 | now sighed softly through the Pass, a wild howling began, which seemed
line = 416 | 1 | to come from all over the country, as far as the imagination could grasp
line = 417 | 1 | it through the gloom of the night. At the first howl the horses began to
line = 418 | 1 | strain and rear, but the driver spoke to them soothingly, and they
line = 419 | 1 | quieted down, but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from
line = 420 | 1 | sudden fright. Then, far off in the distance, from the mountains on each
line = 421 | 1 | side of us began a louder and a sharper howling--that of wolves--which
line = 422 | 1 | affected both the horses and myself in the same way--for I was minded to
line = 423 | 1 | jump from the calèche and run, whilst they reared again and plunged
line = 424 | 1 | madly, so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them
line = 425 | 1 | from bolting. In a few minutes, however, my own ears got accustomed to
line = 426 | 1 | the sound, and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able
line = 427 | 1 | to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and
line = 428 | 1 | whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers
line = 429 | 1 | doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
line = 430 | 1 | quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again
line = 431 | 1 | took his seat, and shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This
line = 432 | 1 | time, after going to the far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a
line = 433 | 1 | narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.
line = 434 | 1 | 
line = 435 | 1 | Soon we were hemmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the
line = 436 | 1 | roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning
line = 437 | 1 | rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we
line = 438 | 1 | could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the
line = 439 | 1 | rocks, and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along.
line = 440 | 1 | It grew colder and colder still, and fine, powdery snow began to fall,
line = 441 | 1 | so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket. The
line = 442 | 1 | keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew
line = 443 | 1 | fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer
line = 444 | 1 | and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I
line = 445 | 1 | grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,
line = 446 | 1 | however, was not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to
line = 447 | 1 | left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.
line = 448 | 1 | 
line = 449 | 1 | Suddenly, away on our left, I saw a faint flickering blue flame. The
line = 450 | 1 | driver saw it at the same moment; he at once checked the horses, and,
line = 451 | 1 | jumping to the ground, disappeared into the darkness. I did not know
line = 452 | 1 | what to do, the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer; but while
line = 453 | 1 | I wondered the driver suddenly appeared again, and without a word took
line = 454 | 1 | his seat, and we resumed our journey. I think I must have fallen asleep
line = 455 | 1 | and kept dreaming of the incident, for it seemed to be repeated
line = 456 | 1 | endlessly, and now looking back, it is like a sort of awful nightmare.
line = 457 | 1 | Once the flame appeared so near the road, that even in the darkness
line = 458 | 1 | around us I could watch the driver's motions. He went rapidly to where
line = 459 | 1 | the blue flame arose--it must have been very faint, for it did not seem
line = 460 | 1 | to illumine the place around it at all--and gathering a few stones,
line = 461 | 1 | formed them into some device. Once there appeared a strange optical
line = 462 | 1 | effect: when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it,
line = 463 | 1 | for I could see its ghostly flicker all the same. This startled me, but
line = 464 | 1 | as the effect was only momentary, I took it that my eyes deceived me
line = 465 | 1 | straining through the darkness. Then for a time there were no blue
line = 466 | 1 | flames, and we sped onwards through the gloom, with the howling of the
line = 467 | 1 | wolves around us, as though they were following in a moving circle.
line = 468 | 1 | 
line = 469 | 1 | At last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he
line = 470 | 1 | had yet gone, and during his absence, the horses began to tremble worse
line = 471 | 1 | than ever and to snort and scream with fright. I could not see any cause
line = 472 | 1 | for it, for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether; but just
line = 473 | 1 | then the moon, sailing through the black clouds, appeared behind the
line = 474 | 1 | jagged crest of a beetling, pine-clad rock, and by its light I saw
line = 475 | 1 | around us a ring of wolves, with white teeth and lolling red tongues,
line = 476 | 1 | with long, sinewy limbs and shaggy hair. They were a hundred times more
line = 477 | 1 | terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled.
line = 478 | 1 | For myself, I felt a sort of paralysis of fear. It is only when a man
line = 479 | 1 | feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand
line = 480 | 1 | their true import.
line = 481 | 1 | 
line = 482 | 1 | All at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had
line = 483 | 1 | some peculiar effect on them. The horses jumped about and reared, and
line = 484 | 1 | looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see;
line = 485 | 1 | but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side; and they
line = 486 | 1 | had perforce to remain within it. I called to the coachman to come, for
line = 487 | 1 | it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the
line = 488 | 1 | ring and to aid his approach. I shouted and beat the side of the
line = 489 | 1 | calèche, hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side, so as
line = 490 | 1 | to give him a chance of reaching the trap. How he came there, I know
line = 491 | 1 | not, but I heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command, and
line = 492 | 1 | looking towards the sound, saw him stand in the roadway. As he swept his
line = 493 | 1 | long arms, as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle, the wolves
line = 494 | 1 | fell back and back further still. Just then a heavy cloud passed across
line = 495 | 1 | the face of the moon, so that we were again in darkness.
line = 496 | 1 | 
line = 497 | 1 | When I could see again the driver was climbing into the calèche, and the
line = 498 | 1 | wolves had disappeared. This was all so strange and uncanny that a
line = 499 | 1 | dreadful fear came upon me, and I was afraid to speak or move. The time
line = 500 | 1 | seemed interminable as we swept on our way, now in almost complete
line = 501 | 1 | darkness, for the rolling clouds obscured the moon. We kept on
line = 502 | 1 | ascending, with occasional periods of quick descent, but in the main
line = 503 | 1 | always ascending. Suddenly, I became conscious of the fact that the
line = 504 | 1 | driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a
line = 505 | 1 | vast ruined castle, from whose tall black windows came no ray of light,
line = 506 | 1 | and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit
line = 507 | 1 | sky.
line = 508 | 1 | 
line = 509 | 1 | 
line = 510 | 1 |

line = 512 | 1 | CHAPTER II
line = 513 | 1 | 
line = 514 | 1 | JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL--_continued_
line = 515 | 1 | 
line = 516 | 1 | 
line = 517 | 1 | _5 May._--I must have been asleep, for certainly if I had been fully
line = 518 | 1 | awake I must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place. In
line = 519 | 1 | the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size, and as several dark
line = 520 | 1 | ways led from it under great round arches, it perhaps seemed bigger than
line = 521 | 1 | it really is. I have not yet been able to see it by daylight.
line = 522 | 1 | 
line = 523 | 1 | When the calèche stopped, the driver jumped down and held out his hand
line = 524 | 1 | to assist me to alight. Again I could not but notice his prodigious
line = 525 | 1 | strength. His hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have
line = 526 | 1 | crushed mine if he had chosen. Then he took out my traps, and placed
line = 527 | 1 | them on the ground beside me as I stood close to a great door, old and
line = 528 | 1 | studded with large iron nails, and set in a projecting doorway of
line = 529 | 1 | massive stone. I could see even in the dim light that the stone was
line = 530 | 1 | massively carved, but that the carving had been much worn by time and
line = 531 | 1 | weather. As I stood, the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the
line = 532 | 1 | reins; the horses started forward, and trap and all disappeared down one
line = 533 | 1 | of the dark openings.
line = 534 | 1 | 
line = 535 | 1 | I stood in silence where I was, for I did not know what to do. Of bell
line = 536 | 1 | or knocker there was no sign; through these frowning walls and dark
line = 537 | 1 | window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate. The
line = 538 | 1 | time I waited seemed endless, and I felt doubts and fears crowding upon
line = 539 | 1 | me. What sort of place had I come to, and among what kind of people?
line = 540 | 1 | What sort of grim adventure was it on which I had embarked? Was this a
line = 541 | 1 | customary incident in the life of a solicitor's clerk sent out to
line = 542 | 1 | explain the purchase of a London estate to a foreigner? Solicitor's
line = 543 | 1 | clerk! Mina would not like that. Solicitor--for just before leaving
line = 544 | 1 | London I got word that my examination was successful; and I am now a
line = 545 | 1 | full-blown solicitor! I began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if
line = 546 | 1 | I were awake. It all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me, and I
line = 547 | 1 | expected that I should suddenly awake, and find myself at home, with
line = 548 | 1 | the dawn struggling in through the windows, as I had now and again felt
line = 549 | 1 | in the morning after a day of overwork. But my flesh answered the
line = 550 | 1 | pinching test, and my eyes were not to be deceived. I was indeed awake
line = 551 | 1 | and among the Carpathians. All I could do now was to be patient, and to
line = 552 | 1 | wait the coming of the morning.
line = 553 | 1 | 
line = 554 | 1 | Just as I had come to this conclusion I heard a heavy step approaching
line = 555 | 1 | behind the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming
line = 556 | 1 | light. Then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of
line = 557 | 1 | massive bolts drawn back. A key was turned with the loud grating noise
line = 558 | 1 | of long disuse, and the great door swung back.
line = 559 | 1 | 
line = 560 | 1 | Within, stood a tall old man, clean shaven save for a long white
line = 561 | 1 | moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck
line = 562 | 1 | of colour about him anywhere. He held in his hand an antique silver
line = 563 | 1 | lamp, in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind,
line = 564 | 1 | throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the
line = 565 | 1 | open door. The old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly
line = 566 | 1 | gesture, saying in excellent English, but with a strange intonation:--
line = 567 | 1 | 
line = 568 | 1 | "Welcome to my house! Enter freely and of your own will!" He made no
line = 569 | 1 | motion of stepping to meet me, but stood like a statue, as though his
line = 570 | 1 | gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone. The instant, however, that
line = 571 | 1 | I had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and
line = 572 | 1 | holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince,
line = 573 | 1 | an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as
line = 574 | 1 | ice--more like the hand of a dead than a living man. Again he said:--
line = 575 | 1 | 
line = 576 | 1 | "Welcome to my house. Come freely. Go safely; and leave something of the
line = 577 | 1 | happiness you bring!" The strength of the handshake was so much akin to
line = 578 | 1 | that which I had noticed in the driver, whose face I had not seen, that
line = 579 | 1 | for a moment I doubted if it were not the same person to whom I was
line = 580 | 1 | speaking; so to make sure, I said interrogatively:--
line = 581 | 1 | 
line = 582 | 1 | "Count Dracula?" He bowed in a courtly way as he replied:--
line = 583 | 1 | 
line = 584 | 1 | "I am Dracula; and I bid you welcome, Mr. Harker, to my house. Come in;
line = 585 | 1 | the night air is chill, and you must need to eat and rest." As he was
line = 586 | 1 | speaking, he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall, and stepping out,
line = 587 | 1 | took my luggage; he had carried it in before I could forestall him. I
line = 588 | 1 | protested but he insisted:--
line = 589 | 1 | 
line = 590 | 1 | "Nay, sir, you are my guest. It is late, and my people are not
line = 591 | 1 | available. Let me see to your comfort myself." He insisted on carrying
line = 592 | 1 | my traps along the passage, and then up a great winding stair, and
line = 593 | 1 | along another great passage, on whose stone floor our steps rang
line = 594 | 1 | heavily. At the end of this he threw open a heavy door, and I rejoiced
line = 595 | 1 | to see within a well-lit room in which a table was spread for supper,
line = 596 | 1 | and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs, freshly replenished,
line = 597 | 1 | flamed and flared.
line = 598 | 1 | 
line = 599 | 1 | The Count halted, putting down my bags, closed the door, and crossing
line = 600 | 1 | the room, opened another door, which led into a small octagonal room lit
line = 601 | 1 | by a single lamp, and seemingly without a window of any sort. Passing
line = 602 | 1 | through this, he opened another door, and motioned me to enter. It was a
line = 603 | 1 | welcome sight; for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with
line = 604 | 1 | another log fire,--also added to but lately, for the top logs were
line = 605 | 1 | fresh--which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney. The Count himself
line = 606 | 1 | left my luggage inside and withdrew, saying, before he closed the
line = 607 | 1 | door:--
line = 608 | 1 | 
line = 609 | 1 | "You will need, after your journey, to refresh yourself by making your
line = 610 | 1 | toilet. I trust you will find all you wish. When you are ready, come
line = 611 | 1 | into the other room, where you will find your supper prepared."
line = 612 | 1 | 
line = 613 | 1 | The light and warmth and the Count's courteous welcome seemed to have
line = 614 | 1 | dissipated all my doubts and fears. Having then reached my normal state,
line = 615 | 1 | I discovered that I was half famished with hunger; so making a hasty
line = 616 | 1 | toilet, I went into the other room.
line = 617 | 1 | 
line = 618 | 1 | I found supper already laid out. My host, who stood on one side of the
line = 619 | 1 | great fireplace, leaning against the stonework, made a graceful wave of
line = 620 | 1 | his hand to the table, and said:--
line = 621 | 1 | 
line = 622 | 1 | "I pray you, be seated and sup how you please. You will, I trust, excuse
line = 623 | 1 | me that I do not join you; but I have dined already, and I do not sup."
line = 624 | 1 | 
line = 625 | 1 | I handed to him the sealed letter which Mr. Hawkins had entrusted to me.
line = 626 | 1 | He opened it and read it gravely; then, with a charming smile, he handed
line = 627 | 1 | it to me to read. One passage of it, at least, gave me a thrill of
line = 628 | 1 | pleasure.
line = 629 | 1 | 
line = 630 | 1 | "I must regret that an attack of gout, from which malady I am a constant
line = 631 | 1 | sufferer, forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to
line = 632 | 1 | come; but I am happy to say I can send a sufficient substitute, one in
line = 633 | 1 | whom I have every possible confidence. He is a young man, full of energy
line = 634 | 1 | and talent in his own way, and of a very faithful disposition. He is
line = 635 | 1 | discreet and silent, and has grown into manhood in my service. He shall
line = 636 | 1 | be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay, and shall take
line = 637 | 1 | your instructions in all matters."
line = 638 | 1 | 
line = 639 | 1 | The Count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish, and I
line = 640 | 1 | fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken. This, with some cheese
line = 641 | 1 | and a salad and a bottle of old Tokay, of which I had two glasses, was
line = 642 | 1 | my supper. During the time I was eating it the Count asked me many
line = 643 | 1 | questions as to my journey, and I told him by degrees all I had
line = 644 | 1 | experienced.
line = 645 | 1 | 
line = 646 | 1 | By this time I had finished my supper, and by my host's desire had drawn
line = 647 | 1 | up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me,
line = 648 | 1 | at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke. I had now an
line = 649 | 1 | opportunity of observing him, and found him of a very marked
line = 650 | 1 | physiognomy.
line = 651 | 1 | 
line = 652 | 1 | His face was a strong--a very strong--aquiline, with high bridge of the
line = 653 | 1 | thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils; with lofty domed forehead, and
line = 654 | 1 | hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere. His
line = 655 | 1 | eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, and with bushy
line = 656 | 1 | hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion. The mouth, so far as I
line = 657 | 1 | could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather
line = 658 | 1 | cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth; these protruded over
line = 659 | 1 | the lips, whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a
line = 660 | 1 | man of his years. For the rest, his ears were pale, and at the tops
line = 661 | 1 | extremely pointed; the chin was broad and strong, and the cheeks firm
line = 662 | 1 | though thin. The general effect was one of extraordinary pallor.
line = 663 | 1 | 
line = 664 | 1 | Hitherto I had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees
line = 665 | 1 | in the firelight, and they had seemed rather white and fine; but seeing
line = 666 | 1 | them now close to me, I could not but notice that they were rather
line = 667 | 1 | coarse--broad, with squat fingers. Strange to say, there were hairs in
line = 668 | 1 | the centre of the palm. The nails were long and fine, and cut to a sharp
line = 669 | 1 | point. As the Count leaned over me and his hands touched me, I could not
line = 670 | 1 | repress a shudder. It may have been that his breath was rank, but a
line = 671 | 1 | horrible feeling of nausea came over me, which, do what I would, I could
line = 672 | 1 | not conceal. The Count, evidently noticing it, drew back; and with a
line = 673 | 1 | grim sort of smile, which showed more than he had yet done his
line = 674 | 1 | protuberant teeth, sat himself down again on his own side of the
line = 675 | 1 | fireplace. We were both silent for a while; and as I looked towards the
line = 676 | 1 | window I saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn. There seemed a
line = 677 | 1 | strange stillness over everything; but as I listened I heard as if from
line = 678 | 1 | down below in the valley the howling of many wolves. The Count's eyes
line = 679 | 1 | gleamed, and he said:--
line = 680 | 1 | 
line = 681 | 1 | "Listen to them--the children of the night. What music they make!"
line = 682 | 1 | Seeing, I suppose, some expression in my face strange to him, he
line = 683 | 1 | added:--
line = 684 | 1 | 
line = 685 | 1 | "Ah, sir, you dwellers in the city cannot enter into the feelings of the
line = 686 | 1 | hunter." Then he rose and said:--
line = 687 | 1 | 
line = 688 | 1 | "But you must be tired. Your bedroom is all ready, and to-morrow you
line = 689 | 1 | shall sleep as late as you will. I have to be away till the afternoon;
line = 690 | 1 | so sleep well and dream well!" With a courteous bow, he opened for me
line = 691 | 1 | himself the door to the octagonal room, and I entered my bedroom....
line = 692 | 1 | 
line = 693 | 1 | I am all in a sea of wonders. I doubt; I fear; I think strange things,
line = 694 | 1 | which I dare not confess to my own soul. God keep me, if only for the
line = 695 | 1 | sake of those dear to me!
line = 696 | 1 | 
line = 697 | 1 |        *       *       *       *       *
line = 698 | 1 | 
line = 699 | 1 | _7 May._--It is again early morning, but I have rested and enjoyed the
line = 700 | 1 | last twenty-four hours. I slept till late in the day, and awoke of my
line = 701 | 1 | own accord. When I had dressed myself I went into the room where we had
line = 702 | 1 | supped, and found a cold breakfast laid out, with coffee kept hot by the
line = 703 | 1 | pot being placed on the hearth. There was a card on the table, on which
line = 704 | 1 | was written:--
line = 705 | 1 | 
line = 706 | 1 | "I have to be absent for a while. Do not wait for me.--D." I set to and
line = 707 | 1 | enjoyed a hearty meal. When I had done, I looked for a bell, so that I
line = 708 | 1 | might let the servants know I had finished; but I could not find one.
line = 709 | 1 | There are certainly odd deficiencies in the house, considering the
line = 710 | 1 | extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me. The table service
line = 711 | 1 | is of gold, and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value.
line = 712 | 1 | The curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of
line = 713 | 1 | my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics, and must have
line = 714 | 1 | been of fabulous value when they were made, for they are centuries old,
line = 715 | 1 | though in excellent order. I saw something like them in Hampton Court,
line = 716 | 1 | but there they were worn and frayed and moth-eaten. But still in none of
line = 717 | 1 | the rooms is there a mirror. There is not even a toilet glass on my
line = 718 | 1 | table, and I had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before I
line = 719 | 1 | could either shave or brush my hair. I have not yet seen a servant
line = 720 | 1 | anywhere, or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves.
line = 721 | 1 | Some time after I had finished my meal--I do not know whether to call it
line = 722 | 1 | breakfast or dinner, for it was between five and six o'clock when I had
line = 723 | 1 | it--I looked about for something to read, for I did not like to go about
line = 724 | 1 | the castle until I had asked the Count's permission. There was
line = 725 | 1 | absolutely nothing in the room, book, newspaper, or even writing
line = 726 | 1 | materials; so I opened another door in the room and found a sort of
line = 727 | 1 | library. The door opposite mine I tried, but found it locked.
line = 728 | 1 | 
line = 729 | 1 | In the library I found, to my great delight, a vast number of English
line = 730 | 1 | books, whole shelves full of them, and bound volumes of magazines and
line = 731 | 1 | newspapers. A table in the centre was littered with English magazines
line = 732 | 1 | and newspapers, though none of them were of very recent date. The books
line = 733 | 1 | were of the most varied kind--history, geography, politics, political
line = 734 | 1 | economy, botany, geology, law--all relating to England and English life
line = 735 | 1 | and customs and manners. There were even such books of reference as the
line = 736 | 1 | London Directory, the "Red" and "Blue" books, Whitaker's Almanac, the
line = 737 | 1 | Army and Navy Lists, and--it somehow gladdened my heart to see it--the
line = 738 | 1 | Law List.
line = 739 | 1 | 
line = 740 | 1 | Whilst I was looking at the books, the door opened, and the Count
line = 741 | 1 | entered. He saluted me in a hearty way, and hoped that I had had a good
line = 742 | 1 | night's rest. Then he went on:--
line = 743 | 1 | 
line = 744 | 1 | "I am glad you found your way in here, for I am sure there is much that
line = 745 | 1 | will interest you. These companions"--and he laid his hand on some of
line = 746 | 1 | the books--"have been good friends to me, and for some years past, ever
line = 747 | 1 | since I had the idea of going to London, have given me many, many hours
line = 748 | 1 | of pleasure. Through them I have come to know your great England; and to
line = 749 | 1 | know her is to love her. I long to go through the crowded streets of
line = 750 | 1 | your mighty London, to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of
line = 751 | 1 | humanity, to share its life, its change, its death, and all that makes
line = 752 | 1 | it what it is. But alas! as yet I only know your tongue through books.
line = 753 | 1 | To you, my friend, I look that I know it to speak."
line = 754 | 1 | 
line = 755 | 1 | "But, Count," I said, "you know and speak English thoroughly!" He bowed
line = 756 | 1 | gravely.
line = 757 | 1 | 
line = 758 | 1 | "I thank you, my friend, for your all too-flattering estimate, but yet I
line = 759 | 1 | fear that I am but a little way on the road I would travel. True, I know
line = 760 | 1 | the grammar and the words, but yet I know not how to speak them."
line = 761 | 1 | 
line = 762 | 1 | "Indeed," I said, "you speak excellently."
line = 763 | 1 | 
line = 764 | 1 | "Not so," he answered. "Well, I know that, did I move and speak in your
line = 765 | 1 | London, none there are who would not know me for a stranger. That is not
line = 766 | 1 | enough for me. Here I am noble; I am _boyar_; the common people know me,
line = 767 | 1 | and I am master. But a stranger in a strange land, he is no one; men
line = 768 | 1 | know him not--and to know not is to care not for. I am content if I am
line = 769 | 1 | like the rest, so that no man stops if he see me, or pause in his
line = 770 | 1 | speaking if he hear my words, 'Ha, ha! a stranger!' I have been so long
line = 771 | 1 | master that I would be master still--or at least that none other should
line = 772 | 1 | be master of me. You come to me not alone as agent of my friend Peter
line = 773 | 1 | Hawkins, of Exeter, to tell me all about my new estate in London. You
line = 774 | 1 | shall, I trust, rest here with me awhile, so that by our talking I may
line = 775 | 1 | learn the English intonation; and I would that you tell me when I make
line = 776 | 1 | error, even of the smallest, in my speaking. I am sorry that I had to be
line = 777 | 1 | away so long to-day; but you will, I know, forgive one who has so many
line = 778 | 1 | important affairs in hand."

line = 780 | 1 | of its curves. They have, for the first stages, two men to ride and lead
line = 781 | 1 | their spare horses--four in all, so as not to excite curiosity. When
line = 782 | 1 | they dismiss the men, which shall be shortly, they shall themselves look
line = 783 | 1 | after the horses. It may be necessary for us to join forces; if so they
line = 784 | 1 | can mount our whole party. One of the saddles has a movable horn, and
line = 785 | 1 | can be easily adapted for Mina, if required.
line = 786 | 1 | 
line = 787 | 1 | It is a wild adventure we are on. Here, as we are rushing along through
line = 788 | 1 | the darkness, with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike
line = 789 | 1 | us; with all the mysterious voices of the night around us, it all comes
line = 790 | 1 | home. We seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways; into
line = 791 | 1 | a whole world of dark and dreadful things. Godalming is shutting the
line = 792 | 1 | furnace door....

line = 797 | 1 | sleeping. I am on watch. The morning is bitterly cold; the furnace heat
line = 798 | 1 | is grateful, though we have heavy fur coats. As yet we have passed only
line = 799 | 1 | a few open boats, but none of them had on board any box or package of
line = 800 | 1 | anything like the size of the one we seek. The men were scared every
line = 801 | 1 | time we turned our electric lamp on them, and fell on their knees and
line = 802 | 1 | prayed.

line = 806 | 1 | _1 November, evening._--No news all day; we have found nothing of the
line = 807 | 1 | kind we seek. We have now passed into the Bistritza; and if we are wrong
line = 808 | 1 | in our surmise our chance is gone. We have over-hauled every boat, big
line = 809 | 1 | and little. Early this morning, one crew took us for a Government boat,
line = 810 | 1 | and treated us accordingly. We saw in this a way of smoothing matters,
line = 811 | 1 | so at Fundu, where the Bistritza runs into the Sereth, we got a
line = 812 | 1 | Roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously. With every boat which we
line = 813 | 1 | have over-hauled since then this trick has succeeded; we have had every
line = 814 | 1 | deference shown to us, and not once any objection to whatever we chose
line = 815 | 1 | to ask or do. Some of the Slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them,
line = 816 | 1 | going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board. This
line = 817 | 1 | was before they came to Fundu, so they could not tell us whether the
line = 818 | 1 | boat turned into the Bistritza or continued on up the Sereth. At Fundu
line = 819 | 1 | we could not hear of any such boat, so she must have passed there in the
line = 820 | 1 | night. I am feeling very sleepy; the cold is perhaps beginning to tell
line = 821 | 1 | upon me, and nature must have rest some time. Godalming insists that he
line = 822 | 1 | shall keep the first watch. God bless him for all his goodness to poor

line = 829 | 1 | was forgetting my trouble. It seems brutally selfish to me to have slept
line = 830 | 1 | so long, and let him watch all night; but he was quite right. I am a new
line = 831 | 1 | man this morning; and, as I sit here and watch him sleeping, I can do
line = 832 | 1 | all that is necessary both as to minding the engine, steering, and
line = 833 | 1 | keeping watch. I can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to
line = 834 | 1 | me. I wonder where Mina is now, and Van Helsing. They should have got to
line = 835 | 1 | Veresti about noon on Wednesday. It would take them some time to get the
line = 836 | 1 | carriage and horses; so if they had started and travelled hard, they
line = 837 | 1 | would be about now at the Borgo Pass. God guide and help them! I am
line = 838 | 1 | afraid to think what may happen. If we could only go faster! but we
line = 839 | 1 | cannot; the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost. I wonder how
line = 840 | 1 | Dr. Seward and Mr. Morris are getting on. There seem to be endless
line = 841 | 1 | streams running down the mountains into this river, but as none of them
line = 842 | 1 | are very large--at present, at all events, though they are terrible
line = 843 | 1 | doubtless in winter and when the snow melts--the horsemen may not have
line = 844 | 1 | met much obstruction. I hope that before we get to Strasba we may see
line = 845 | 1 | them; for if by that time we have not overtaken the Count, it may be
line = 846 | 1 | necessary to take counsel together what to do next.

line = 868 | 1 | up all right, by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge. Some went up
line = 869 | 1 | only a few hours before. Godalming is an amateur fitter himself, and
line = 870 | 1 | evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again. Finally, they got
line = 871 | 1 | up the rapids all right, with local help, and are off on the chase
line = 872 | 1 | afresh. I fear that the boat is not any better for the accident; the
line = 873 | 1 | peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again, she kept
line = 874 | 1 | stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight. We must push

line = 883 | 1 | horses. He says that he will later on try to buy additional horses, so

line = 921 | 1 | _1 November._--All day long we have travelled, and at a good speed. The
line = 922 | 1 | horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated, for they go
line = 923 | 1 | willingly their full stage at best speed. We have now had so many
line = 924 | 1 | changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to
line = 925 | 1 | think that the journey will be an easy one. Dr. Van Helsing is laconic;
line = 926 | 1 | he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays them well
line = 927 | 1 | to make the exchange of horses. We get hot soup, or coffee, or tea; and
line = 928 | 1 | off we go. It is a lovely country; full of beauties of all imaginable
line = 929 | 1 | kinds, and the people are brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full
line = 930 | 1 | of nice qualities. They are _very, very_ superstitious. In the first
line = 931 | 1 | house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the scar on my
line = 932 | 1 | forehead, she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me, to
line = 933 | 1 | keep off the evil eye. I believe they went to the trouble of putting an
line = 934 | 1 | extra amount of garlic into our food; and I can't abide garlic. Ever
line = 935 | 1 | since then I have taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
line = 936 | 1 | escaped their suspicions. We are travelling fast, and as we have no
line = 937 | 1 | driver with us to carry tales, we go ahead of scandal; but I daresay
line = 938 | 1 | that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way. The
line = 939 | 1 | Professor seems tireless; all day he would not take any rest, though he
line = 940 | 1 | made me sleep for a long spell. At sunset time he hypnotised me, and he
line = 941 | 1 | says that I answered as usual "darkness, lapping water and creaking
line = 942 | 1 | wood"; so our enemy is still on the river. I am afraid to think of
line = 943 | 1 | Jonathan, but somehow I have now no fear for him, or for myself. I write
line = 944 | 1 | this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready. Dr.
line = 945 | 1 | Van Helsing is sleeping, Poor dear, he looks very tired and old and
line = 946 | 1 | grey, but his mouth is set as firmly as a conqueror's; even in his sleep
line = 947 | 1 | he is instinct with resolution. When we have well started I must make
line = 948 | 1 | him rest whilst I drive. I shall tell him that we have days before us,
line = 949 | 1 | and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be

line = 956 | 1 | heaviness in the air--I say heaviness for want of a better word; I mean
line = 957 | 1 | that it oppresses us both. It is very cold, and only our warm furs keep
line = 958 | 1 | us comfortable. At dawn Van Helsing hypnotised me; he says I answered
line = 959 | 1 | "darkness, creaking wood and roaring water," so the river is changing as
line = 960 | 1 | they ascend. I do hope that my darling will not run any chance of
line = 961 | 1 | danger--more than need be; but we are in God's hands.

line = 967 | 1 | so far from us and so low on the horizon, now seem to gather round us
line = 968 | 1 | and tower in front. We both seem in good spirits; I think we make an
line = 969 | 1 | effort each to cheer the other; in the doing so we cheer ourselves. Dr.
line = 970 | 1 | Van Helsing says that by morning we shall reach the Borgo Pass. The
line = 971 | 1 | houses are very few here now, and the Professor says that the last horse
line = 972 | 1 | we got will have to go on with us, as we may not be able to change. He
line = 973 | 1 | got two in addition to the two we changed, so that now we have a rude
line = 974 | 1 | four-in-hand. The dear horses are patient and good, and they give us no
line = 975 | 1 | trouble. We are not worried with other travellers, and so even I can
line = 976 | 1 | drive. We shall get to the Pass in daylight; we do not want to arrive
line = 977 | 1 | before. So we take it easy, and have each a long rest in turn. Oh, what
line = 978 | 1 | will to-morrow bring to us? We go to seek the place where my poor
line = 979 | 1 | darling suffered so much. God grant that we may be guided aright, and
line = 980 | 1 | that He will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both,
line = 981 | 1 | and who are in such deadly peril. As for me, I am not worthy in His
line = 982 | 1 | sight. Alas! I am unclean to His eyes, and shall be until He may deign
line = 983 | 1 | to let me stand forth in His sight as one of those who have not incurred

line = 990 | 1 | Purfleet, London, in case I may not see him. It may explain. It is
line = 991 | 1 | morning, and I write by a fire which all the night I have kept
line = 992 | 1 | alive--Madam Mina aiding me. It is cold, cold; so cold that the grey
line = 993 | 1 | heavy sky is full of snow, which when it falls will settle for all
line = 994 | 1 | winter as the ground is hardening to receive it. It seems to have
line = 995 | 1 | affected Madam Mina; she has been so heavy of head all day that she was
line = 996 | 1 | not like herself. She sleeps, and sleeps, and sleeps! She who is usual
line = 997 | 1 | so alert, have done literally nothing all the day; she even have lost
line = 998 | 1 | her appetite. She make no entry into her little diary, she who write so
line = 999 | 1 | faithful at every pause. Something whisper to me that all is not well.
line = 1000 | 1 | However, to-night she is more _vif_. Her long sleep all day have refresh
line = 1001 | 1 | and restore her, for now she is all sweet and bright as ever. At sunset
line = 1002 | 1 | I try to hypnotise her, but alas! with no effect; the power has grown
line = 1003 | 1 | less and less with each day, and to-night it fail me altogether. Well,

line = 1010 | 1 | We got to the Borgo Pass just after sunrise yesterday morning. When I

line = 1012 | 1 | carriage, and got down so that there might be no disturbance. I made a
line = 1013 | 1 | couch with furs, and Madam Mina, lying down, yield herself as usual, but
line = 1014 | 1 | more slow and more short time than ever, to the hypnotic sleep. As
line = 1015 | 1 | before, came the answer: "darkness and the swirling of water." Then she
line = 1016 | 1 | woke, bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the Pass.
line = 1017 | 1 | At this time and place, she become all on fire with zeal; some new
line = 1018 | 1 | guiding power be in her manifested, for she point to a road and say:--
line = 1019 | 1 | 
line = 1020 | 1 | "This is the way."
line = 1021 | 1 | 
line = 1022 | 1 | "How know you it?" I ask.
line = 1023 | 1 | 
line = 1024 | 1 | "Of course I know it," she answer, and with a pause, add: "Have not my
line = 1025 | 1 | Jonathan travelled it and wrote of his travel?"
line = 1026 | 1 | 
line = 1027 | 1 | At first I think somewhat strange, but soon I see that there be only one
line = 1028 | 1 | such by-road. It is used but little, and very different from the coach
line = 1029 | 1 | road from the Bukovina to Bistritz, which is more wide and hard, and
line = 1030 | 1 | more of use.
line = 1031 | 1 | 
line = 1032 | 1 | So we came down this road; when we meet other ways--not always were we
line = 1033 | 1 | sure that they were roads at all, for they be neglect and light snow
line = 1034 | 1 | have fallen--the horses know and they only. I give rein to them, and
line = 1035 | 1 | they go on so patient. By-and-by we find all the things which Jonathan
line = 1036 | 1 | have note in that wonderful diary of him. Then we go on for long, long
line = 1037 | 1 | hours and hours. At the first, I tell Madam Mina to sleep; she try, and
line = 1038 | 1 | she succeed. She sleep all the time; till at the last, I feel myself to
line = 1039 | 1 | suspicious grow, and attempt to wake her. But she sleep on, and I may
line = 1040 | 1 | not wake her though I try. I do not wish to try too hard lest I harm
line = 1041 | 1 | her; for I know that she have suffer much, and sleep at times be
line = 1042 | 1 | all-in-all to her. I think I drowse myself, for all of sudden I feel
line = 1043 | 1 | guilt, as though I have done something; I find myself bolt up, with the
line = 1044 | 1 | reins in my hand, and the good horses go along jog, jog, just as ever. I
line = 1045 | 1 | look down and find Madam Mina still sleep. It is now not far off sunset
line = 1046 | 1 | time, and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood,
line = 1047 | 1 | so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep.
line = 1048 | 1 | For we are going up, and up; and all is oh! so wild and rocky, as though
line = 1049 | 1 | it were the end of the world.
line = 1050 | 1 | 
line = 1051 | 1 | Then I arouse Madam Mina. This time she wake with not much trouble, and
line = 1052 | 1 | then I try to put her to hypnotic sleep. But she sleep not, being as
line = 1053 | 1 | though I were not. Still I try and try, till all at once I find her and
line = 1054 | 1 | myself in dark; so I look round, and find that the sun have gone down.
line = 1055 | 1 | Madam Mina laugh, and I turn and look at her. She is now quite awake,
line = 1056 | 1 | and look so well as I never saw her since that night at Carfax when we
line = 1057 | 1 | first enter the Count's house. I am amaze, and not at ease then; but she
line = 1058 | 1 | is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that I forget all fear. I
line = 1059 | 1 | light a fire, for we have brought supply of wood with us, and she
line = 1060 | 1 | prepare food while I undo the horses and set them, tethered in shelter,
line = 1061 | 1 | to feed. Then when I return to the fire she have my supper ready. I go
line = 1062 | 1 | to help her; but she smile, and tell me that she have eat already--that
line = 1063 | 1 | she was so hungry that she would not wait. I like it not, and I have
line = 1064 | 1 | grave doubts; but I fear to affright her, and so I am silent of it. She
line = 1065 | 1 | help me and I eat alone; and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the
line = 1066 | 1 | fire, and I tell her to sleep while I watch. But presently I forget all
line = 1067 | 1 | of watching; and when I sudden remember that I watch, I find her lying
line = 1068 | 1 | quiet, but awake, and looking at me with so bright eyes. Once, twice
line = 1069 | 1 | more the same occur, and I get much sleep till before morning. When I
line = 1070 | 1 | wake I try to hypnotise her; but alas! though she shut her eyes
line = 1071 | 1 | obedient, she may not sleep. The sun rise up, and up, and up; and then
line = 1072 | 1 | sleep come to her too late, but so heavy that she will not wake. I have
line = 1073 | 1 | to lift her up, and place her sleeping in the carriage when I have
line = 1074 | 1 | harnessed the horses and made all ready. Madam still sleep, and she look
line = 1075 | 1 | in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before. And I like it
line = 1076 | 1 | not. And I am afraid, afraid, afraid!--I am afraid of all things--even
line = 1077 | 1 | to think but I must go on my way. The stake we play for is life and
line = 1078 | 1 | death, or more than these, and we must not flinch.

line = 1083 | 1 | and I have seen some strange things together, you may at the first think
line = 1084 | 1 | that I, Van Helsing, am mad--that the many horrors and the so long
line = 1085 | 1 | strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain.
line = 1086 | 1 | 
line = 1087 | 1 | All yesterday we travel, ever getting closer to the mountains, and
line = 1088 | 1 | moving into a more and more wild and desert land. There are great,
line = 1089 | 1 | frowning precipices and much falling water, and Nature seem to have held
line = 1090 | 1 | sometime her carnival. Madam Mina still sleep and sleep; and though I
line = 1091 | 1 | did have hunger and appeased it, I could not waken her--even for food. I
line = 1092 | 1 | began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her, tainted as
line = 1093 | 1 | she is with that Vampire baptism. "Well," said I to myself, "if it be
line = 1094 | 1 | that she sleep all the day, it shall also be that I do not sleep at
line = 1095 | 1 | night." As we travel on the rough road, for a road of an ancient and
line = 1096 | 1 | imperfect kind there was, I held down my head and slept. Again I waked
line = 1097 | 1 | with a sense of guilt and of time passed, and found Madam Mina still
line = 1098 | 1 | sleeping, and the sun low down. But all was indeed changed; the frowning
line = 1099 | 1 | mountains seemed further away, and we were near the top of a
line = 1100 | 1 | steep-rising hill, on summit of which was such a castle as Jonathan tell
line = 1101 | 1 | of in his diary. At once I exulted and feared; for now, for good or ill,
line = 1102 | 1 | the end was near.
line = 1103 | 1 | 
line = 1104 | 1 | I woke Madam Mina, and again tried to hypnotise her; but alas!
line = 1105 | 1 | unavailing till too late. Then, ere the great dark came upon us--for
line = 1106 | 1 | even after down-sun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow, and
line = 1107 | 1 | all was for a time in a great twilight--I took out the horses and fed
line = 1108 | 1 | them in what shelter I could. Then I make a fire; and near it I make
line = 1109 | 1 | Madam Mina, now awake and more charming than ever, sit comfortable amid
line = 1110 | 1 | her rugs. I got ready food: but she would not eat, simply saying that
line = 1111 | 1 | she had not hunger. I did not press her, knowing her unavailingness. But
line = 1112 | 1 | I myself eat, for I must needs now be strong for all. Then, with the
line = 1113 | 1 | fear on me of what might be, I drew a ring so big for her comfort, round
line = 1114 | 1 | where Madam Mina sat; and over the ring I passed some of the wafer, and
line = 1115 | 1 | I broke it fine so that all was well guarded. She sat still all the
line = 1116 | 1 | time--so still as one dead; and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the
line = 1117 | 1 | snow was not more pale; and no word she said. But when I drew near, she
line = 1118 | 1 | clung to me, and I could know that the poor soul shook her from head to
line = 1119 | 1 | feet with a tremor that was pain to feel. I said to her presently, when
line = 1120 | 1 | she had grown more quiet:--
line = 1121 | 1 | 
line = 1122 | 1 | the other operations, and none of us ever shall. Arthur and Quincey went
line = 1123 | 1 | away together to the station, and Van Helsing and I came on here. The
line = 1124 | 1 | moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of
line = 1125 | 1 | hysterics. He has denied to me since that it was hysterics, and insisted
line = 1126 | 1 | that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very
line = 1127 | 1 | terrible conditions. He laughed till he cried, and I had to draw down
line = 1128 | 1 | the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge; and then he cried,
line = 1129 | 1 | till he laughed again; and laughed and cried together, just as a woman
line = 1130 | 1 | does. I tried to be stern with him, as one is to a woman under the
line = 1131 | 1 | circumstances; but it had no effect. Men and women are so different in
line = 1132 | 1 | manifestations of nervous strength or weakness! Then when his face grew
line = 1133 | 1 | grave and stern again I asked him why his mirth, and why at such a time.
line = 1134 | 1 | His reply was in a way characteristic of him, for it was logical and
line = 1135 | 1 | forceful and mysterious. He said:--
line = 1136 | 1 | 
line = 1137 | 1 | "Ah, you don't comprehend, friend John. Do not think that I am not sad,
line = 1138 | 1 | though I laugh. See, I have cried even when the laugh did choke me. But
line = 1139 | 1 | no more think that I am all sorry when I cry, for the laugh he come
line = 1140 | 1 | just the same. Keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your
line = 1141 | 1 | door and say, 'May I come in?' is not the true laughter. No! he is a
line = 1142 | 1 | king, and he come when and how he like. He ask no person; he choose no
line = 1143 | 1 | time of suitability. He say, 'I am here.' Behold, in example I grieve my
line = 1144 | 1 | heart out for that so sweet young girl; I give my blood for her, though
line = 1145 | 1 | I am old and worn; I give my time, my skill, my sleep; I let my other
line = 1146 | 1 | sufferers want that so she may have all. And yet I can laugh at her very
line = 1147 | 1 | grave--laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her
line = 1148 | 1 | coffin and say 'Thud! thud!' to my heart, till it send back the blood
line = 1149 | 1 | from my cheek. My heart bleed for that poor boy--that dear boy, so of
line = 1150 | 1 | the age of mine own boy had I been so blessed that he live, and with his
line = 1151 | 1 | hair and eyes the same. There, you know now why I love him so. And yet
line = 1152 | 1 | when he say things that touch my husband-heart to the quick, and make my
line = 1153 | 1 | father-heart yearn to him as to no other man--not even to you, friend
line = 1154 | 1 | John, for we are more level in experiences than father and son--yet even
line = 1155 | 1 | at such moment King Laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear,
line = 1156 | 1 | 'Here I am! here I am!' till the blood come dance back and bring some of
line = 1157 | 1 | the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek. Oh, friend John, it is
line = 1158 | 1 | a strange world, a sad world, a world full of miseries, and woes, and
line = 1159 | 1 | troubles; and yet when King Laugh come he make them all dance to the
line = 1160 | 1 | tune he play. Bleeding hearts, and dry bones of the churchyard, and
line = 1161 | 1 | tears that burn as they fall--all dance together to the music that he
line = 1162 | 1 | make with that smileless mouth of him. And believe me, friend John, that
line = 1163 | 1 | he is good to come, and kind. Ah, we men and women are like ropes drawn
line = 1164 | 1 | tight with strain that pull us different ways. Then tears come; and,
line = 1165 | 1 | like the rain on the ropes, they brace us up, until perhaps the strain
line = 1166 | 1 | become too great, and we break. But King Laugh he come like the
line = 1167 | 1 | sunshine, and he ease off the strain again; and we bear to go on with
line = 1168 | 1 | our labour, what it may be."
line = 1169 | 1 | 
line = 1170 | 1 | I did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea; but, as I
line = 1171 | 1 | did not yet understand the cause of his laughter, I asked him. As he
line = 1172 | 1 | answered me his face grew stern, and he said in quite a different
line = 1173 | 1 | tone:--
line = 1174 | 1 | 
line = 1175 | 1 | "Oh, it was the grim irony of it all--this so lovely lady garlanded with
line = 1176 | 1 | flowers, that looked so fair as life, till one by one we wondered if she
line = 1177 | 1 | were truly dead; she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely
line = 1178 | 1 | churchyard, where rest so many of her kin, laid there with the mother
line = 1179 | 1 | who loved her, and whom she loved; and that sacred bell going 'Toll!
line = 1180 | 1 | toll! toll!' so sad and slow; and those holy men, with the white
line = 1181 | 1 | garments of the angel, pretending to read books, and yet all the time
line = 1182 | 1 | their eyes never on the page; and all of us with the bowed head. And all
line = 1183 | 1 | for what? She is dead; so! Is it not?"
line = 1184 | 1 | 
line = 1185 | 1 | "Well, for the life of me, Professor," I said, "I can't see anything to
line = 1186 | 1 | laugh at in all that. Why, your explanation makes it a harder puzzle
line = 1187 | 1 | than before. But even if the burial service was comic, what about poor
line = 1188 | 1 | Art and his trouble? Why, his heart was simply breaking."
line = 1189 | 1 | 
line = 1190 | 1 | "Just so. Said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had
line = 1191 | 1 | made her truly his bride?"
line = 1192 | 1 | 
line = 1193 | 1 | "Yes, and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him."
line = 1194 | 1 | 
line = 1195 | 1 | "Quite so. But there was a difficulty, friend John. If so that, then
line = 1196 | 1 | what about the others? Ho, ho! Then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist,
line = 1197 | 1 | and me, with my poor wife dead to me, but alive by Church's law, though
line = 1198 | 1 | no wits, all gone--even I, who am faithful husband to this now-no-wife,
line = 1199 | 1 | am bigamist."
line = 1200 | 1 | 
line = 1201 | 1 | "I don't see where the joke comes in there either!" I said; and I did
line = 1202 | 1 | not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things. He laid
line = 1203 | 1 | his hand on my arm, and said:--
line = 1204 | 1 | 
line = 1205 | 1 | "Friend John, forgive me if I pain. I showed not my feeling to others
line = 1206 | 1 | when it would wound, but only to you, my old friend, whom I can trust.
line = 1207 | 1 | If you could have looked into my very heart then when I want to laugh;
line = 1208 | 1 | if you could have done so when the laugh arrived; if you could do so
line = 1209 | 1 | now, when King Laugh have pack up his crown, and all that is to him--for
line = 1210 | 1 | he go far, far away from me, and for a long, long time--maybe you would
line = 1211 | 1 | perhaps pity me the most of all."
line = 1212 | 1 | 
line = 1213 | 1 | I was touched by the tenderness of his tone, and asked why.
line = 1214 | 1 | 
line = 1215 | 1 | "Because I know!"
line = 1216 | 1 | 
line = 1217 | 1 | And now we are all scattered; and for many a long day loneliness will
line = 1218 | 1 | sit over our roofs with brooding wings. Lucy lies in the tomb of her
line = 1219 | 1 | kin, a lordly death-house in a lonely churchyard, away from teeming

line = 1235 | 1 | 
line = 1236 | 1 | 
line = 1237 | 1 | The neighbourhood of Hampstead is just at present exercised with a
line = 1238 | 1 | series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what
line = 1239 | 1 | was known to the writers of headlines as "The Kensington Horror," or
line = 1240 | 1 | "The Stabbing Woman," or "The Woman in Black." During the past two or
line = 1241 | 1 | three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from
line = 1242 | 1 | home or neglecting to return from their playing on the Heath. In all
line = 1243 | 1 | these cases the children were too young to give any properly
line = 1244 | 1 | intelligible account of themselves, but the consensus of their excuses
line = 1245 | 1 | is that they had been with a "bloofer lady." It has always been late in
line = 1246 | 1 | the evening when they have been missed, and on two occasions the
line = 1247 | 1 | children have not been found until early in the following morning. It is
line = 1248 | 1 | generally supposed in the neighbourhood that, as the first child missed
line = 1249 | 1 | gave as his reason for being away that a "bloofer lady" had asked him to
line = 1250 | 1 | come for a walk, the others had picked up the phrase and used it as
line = 1251 | 1 | occasion served. This is the more natural as the favourite game of the
line = 1252 | 1 | little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles. A
line = 1253 | 1 | correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to
line = 1254 | 1 | be the "bloofer lady" is supremely funny. Some of our caricaturists
line = 1255 | 1 | might, he says, take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the
line = 1256 | 1 | reality and the picture. It is only in accordance with general
line = 1257 | 1 | principles of human nature that the "bloofer lady" should be the popular
line = 1258 | 1 | rôle at these _al fresco_ performances. Our correspondent naïvely says
line = 1259 | 1 | that even Ellen Terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of
line = 1260 | 1 | these grubby-faced little children pretend--and even imagine
line = 1261 | 1 | themselves--to be.
line = 1262 | 1 | 
line = 1263 | 1 | There is, however, possibly a serious side to the question, for some of
line = 1264 | 1 | the children, indeed all who have been missed at night, have been
line = 1265 | 1 | slightly torn or wounded in the throat. The wounds seem such as might be
line = 1266 | 1 | made by a rat or a small dog, and although of not much importance
line = 1267 | 1 | individually, would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has
line = 1268 | 1 | a system or method of its own. The police of the division have been
line = 1269 | 1 | instructed to keep a sharp look-out for straying children, especially
line = 1270 | 1 | when very young, in and around Hampstead Heath, and for any stray dog
line = 1271 | 1 | which may be about.

line = 1354 | 1 | pardon, madam. I have read your letters to poor Lucy, and know how good
line = 1355 | 1 | you are and how your husband suffer; so I pray you, if it may be,
line = 1356 | 1 | enlighten him not, lest it may harm. Again your pardon, and forgive me.

line = 1370 | 1 | _25 September._--I cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time
line = 1371 | 1 | draws near for the visit of Dr. Van Helsing, for somehow I expect that
line = 1372 | 1 | it will throw some light upon Jonathan's sad experience; and as he
line = 1373 | 1 | attended poor dear Lucy in her last illness, he can tell me all about
line = 1374 | 1 | her. That is the reason of his coming; it is concerning Lucy and her
line = 1375 | 1 | sleep-walking, and not about Jonathan. Then I shall never know the real
line = 1376 | 1 | truth now! How silly I am. That awful journal gets hold of my
line = 1377 | 1 | imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour. Of
line = 1378 | 1 | course it is about Lucy. That habit came back to the poor dear, and that
line = 1379 | 1 | awful night on the cliff must have made her ill. I had almost forgotten
line = 1380 | 1 | in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards. She must have told him
line = 1381 | 1 | of her sleep-walking adventure on the cliff, and that I knew all about
line = 1382 | 1 | it; and now he wants me to tell him what she knows, so that he may
line = 1383 | 1 | understand. I hope I did right in not saying anything of it to Mrs.
line = 1384 | 1 | Westenra; I should never forgive myself if any act of mine, were it even
line = 1385 | 1 | a negative one, brought harm on poor dear Lucy. I hope, too, Dr. Van
line = 1386 | 1 | Helsing will not blame me; I have had so much trouble and anxiety of
line = 1387 | 1 | late that I feel I cannot bear more just at present.
line = 1388 | 1 | 
line = 1389 | 1 | I suppose a cry does us all good at times--clears the air as other rain
line = 1390 | 1 | does. Perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me, and
line = 1391 | 1 | then Jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day
line = 1392 | 1 | and night, the first time we have been parted since our marriage. I do
line = 1393 | 1 | hope the dear fellow will take care of himself, and that nothing will
line = 1394 | 1 | occur to upset him. It is two o'clock, and the doctor will be here soon
line = 1395 | 1 | now. I shall say nothing of Jonathan's journal unless he asks me. I am
line = 1396 | 1 | so glad I have type-written out my own journal, so that, in case he asks
line = 1397 | 1 | about Lucy, I can hand it to him; it will save much questioning.

line = 1402 | 1 | all makes my head whirl round! I feel like one in a dream. Can it be all
line = 1403 | 1 | possible, or even a part of it? If I had not read Jonathan's journal
line = 1404 | 1 | first, I should never have accepted even a possibility. Poor, poor, dear
line = 1405 | 1 | Jonathan! How he must have suffered. Please the good God, all this may
line = 1406 | 1 | not upset him again. I shall try to save him from it; but it may be even
line = 1407 | 1 | a consolation and a help to him--terrible though it be and awful in its
line = 1408 | 1 | consequences--to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did
line = 1409 | 1 | not deceive him, and that it is all true. It may be that it is the doubt
line = 1410 | 1 | which haunts him; that when the doubt is removed, no matter
line = 1411 | 1 | which--waking or dreaming--may prove the truth, he will be more
line = 1412 | 1 | satisfied and better able to bear the shock. Dr. Van Helsing must be a
line = 1413 | 1 | good man as well as a clever one if he is Arthur's friend and Dr.
line = 1414 | 1 | Seward's, and if they brought him all the way from Holland to look after
line = 1415 | 1 | Lucy. I feel from having seen him that he _is_ good and kind and of a
line = 1416 | 1 | noble nature. When he comes to-morrow I shall ask him about Jonathan;
line = 1417 | 1 | and then, please God, all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good
line = 1418 | 1 | end. I used to think I would like to practise interviewing; Jonathan's
line = 1419 | 1 | friend on "The Exeter News" told him that memory was everything in such
line = 1420 | 1 | work--that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word
line = 1421 | 1 | spoken, even if you had to refine some of it afterwards. Here was a rare
line = 1422 | 1 | interview; I shall try to record it _verbatim_.
line = 1423 | 1 | 
line = 1424 | 1 | It was half-past two o'clock when the knock came. I took my courage _à
line = 1425 | 1 | deux mains_ and waited. In a few minutes Mary opened the door, and
line = 1426 | 1 | announced "Dr. Van Helsing."
line = 1427 | 1 | 
line = 1428 | 1 | I rose and bowed, and he came towards me; a man of medium weight,
line = 1429 | 1 | strongly built, with his shoulders set back over a broad, deep chest and
line = 1430 | 1 | a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck. The poise
line = 1431 | 1 | of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power; the
line = 1432 | 1 | head is noble, well-sized, broad, and large behind the ears. The face,
line = 1433 | 1 | clean-shaven, shows a hard, square chin, a large, resolute, mobile
line = 1434 | 1 | mouth, a good-sized nose, rather straight, but with quick, sensitive
line = 1435 | 1 | nostrils, that seem to broaden as the big, bushy brows come down and the
line = 1436 | 1 | mouth tightens. The forehead is broad and fine, rising at first almost
line = 1437 | 1 | straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart;
line = 1438 | 1 | such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it,
line = 1439 | 1 | but falls naturally back and to the sides. Big, dark blue eyes are set
line = 1440 | 1 | widely apart, and are quick and tender or stern with the man's moods. He
line = 1441 | 1 | said to me:--
line = 1442 | 1 | 
line = 1443 | 1 | "Mrs. Harker, is it not?" I bowed assent.
line = 1444 | 1 | 
line = 1445 | 1 | "That was Miss Mina Murray?" Again I assented.
line = 1446 | 1 | 
line = 1447 | 1 | "It is Mina Murray that I came to see that was friend of that poor dear
line = 1448 | 1 | child Lucy Westenra. Madam Mina, it is on account of the dead I come."
line = 1449 | 1 | 
line = 1450 | 1 | "Sir," I said, "you could have no better claim on me than that you were
line = 1451 | 1 | a friend and helper of Lucy Westenra." And I held out my hand. He took
line = 1452 | 1 | it and said tenderly:--
line = 1453 | 1 | 
line = 1454 | 1 | "Oh, Madam Mina, I knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be
line = 1455 | 1 | good, but I had yet to learn----" He finished his speech with a courtly
line = 1456 | 1 | bow. I asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about, so he at
line = 1457 | 1 | once began:--
line = 1458 | 1 | 
line = 1459 | 1 | "I have read your letters to Miss Lucy. Forgive me, but I had to begin
line = 1460 | 1 | to inquire somewhere, and there was none to ask. I know that you were
line = 1461 | 1 | with her at Whitby. She sometimes kept a diary--you need not look
line = 1462 | 1 | surprised, Madam Mina; it was begun after you had left, and was in
line = 1463 | 1 | imitation of you--and in that diary she traces by inference certain
line = 1464 | 1 | things to a sleep-walking in which she puts down that you saved her. In
line = 1465 | 1 | great perplexity then I come to you, and ask you out of your so much
line = 1466 | 1 | kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember."
line = 1467 | 1 | 
line = 1468 | 1 | "I can tell you, I think, Dr. Van Helsing, all about it."
line = 1469 | 1 | 
line = 1470 | 1 | "Ah, then you have good memory for facts, for details? It is not always
line = 1471 | 1 | so with young ladies."
line = 1472 | 1 | 
line = 1473 | 1 | "No, doctor, but I wrote it all down at the time. I can show it to you
line = 1474 | 1 | if you like."
line = 1475 | 1 | 
line = 1476 | 1 | "Oh, Madam Mina, I will be grateful; you will do me much favour." I
line = 1477 | 1 | could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit--I suppose it is
line = 1478 | 1 | some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our
line = 1479 | 1 | mouths--so I handed him the shorthand diary. He took it with a grateful
line = 1480 | 1 | bow, and said:--
line = 1481 | 1 | 
line = 1482 | 1 | "May I read it?"
line = 1483 | 1 | 
line = 1484 | 1 | "If you wish," I answered as demurely as I could. He opened it, and for
line = 1485 | 1 | an instant his face fell. Then he stood up and bowed.
line = 1486 | 1 | 
line = 1487 | 1 | "Oh, you so clever woman!" he said. "I knew long that Mr. Jonathan was a
line = 1488 | 1 | man of much thankfulness; but see, his wife have all the good things.
line = 1489 | 1 | And will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me?
line = 1490 | 1 | Alas! I know not the shorthand." By this time my little joke was over,
line = 1491 | 1 | and I was almost ashamed; so I took the typewritten copy from my
line = 1492 | 1 | workbasket and handed it to him.
line = 1493 | 1 | 
line = 1494 | 1 | "Forgive me," I said: "I could not help it; but I had been thinking that
line = 1495 | 1 | it was of dear Lucy that you wished to ask, and so that you might not
line = 1496 | 1 | have time to wait--not on my account, but because I know your time must
line = 1497 | 1 | be precious--I have written it out on the typewriter for you."
line = 1498 | 1 | 
line = 1499 | 1 | He took it and his eyes glistened. "You are so good," he said. "And may
line = 1500 | 1 | I read it now? I may want to ask you some things when I have read."
line = 1501 | 1 | 
line = 1502 | 1 | "By all means," I said, "read it over whilst I order lunch; and then you
line = 1503 | 1 | can ask me questions whilst we eat." He bowed and settled himself in a
line = 1504 | 1 | chair with his back to the light, and became absorbed in the papers,
line = 1505 | 1 | whilst I went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be
line = 1506 | 1 | disturbed. When I came back, I found him walking hurriedly up and down
line = 1507 | 1 | the room, his face all ablaze with excitement. He rushed up to me and
line = 1508 | 1 | took me by both hands.
line = 1509 | 1 | 
line = 1510 | 1 | "Oh, Madam Mina," he said, "how can I say what I owe to you? This paper
line = 1511 | 1 | is as sunshine. It opens the gate to me. I am daze, I am dazzle, with so
line = 1512 | 1 | much light, and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time. But that
line = 1513 | 1 | you do not, cannot, comprehend. Oh, but I am grateful to you, you so
line = 1514 | 1 | clever woman. Madam"--he said this very solemnly--"if ever Abraham Van
line = 1515 | 1 | Helsing can do anything for you or yours, I trust you will let me know.
line = 1516 | 1 | It will be pleasure and delight if I may serve you as a friend; as a
line = 1517 | 1 | friend, but all I have ever learned, all I can ever do, shall be for you
line = 1518 | 1 | and those you love. There are darknesses in life, and there are lights;
line = 1519 | 1 | you are one of the lights. You will have happy life and good life, and
line = 1520 | 1 | your husband will be blessed in you."
line = 1521 | 1 | 
line = 1522 | 1 | "But, doctor, you praise me too much, and--and you do not know me."
line = 1523 | 1 | 
line = 1524 | 1 | "Not know you--I, who am old, and who have studied all my life men and
line = 1525 | 1 | women; I, who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to
line = 1526 | 1 | him and all that follow from him! And I have read your diary that you
line = 1527 | 1 | have so goodly written for me, and which breathes out truth in every
line = 1528 | 1 | line. I, who have read your so sweet letter to poor Lucy of your
line = 1529 | 1 | marriage and your trust, not know you! Oh, Madam Mina, good women tell
line = 1530 | 1 | all their lives, and by day and by hour and by minute, such things that
line = 1531 | 1 | angels can read; and we men who wish to know have in us something of
line = 1532 | 1 | angels' eyes. Your husband is noble nature, and you are noble too, for
line = 1533 | 1 | you trust, and trust cannot be where there is mean nature. And your
line = 1534 | 1 | husband--tell me of him. Is he quite well? Is all that fever gone, and
line = 1535 | 1 | is he strong and hearty?" I saw here an opening to ask him about
line = 1536 | 1 | Jonathan, so I said:--
line = 1537 | 1 | 
line = 1538 | 1 | "He was almost recovered, but he has been greatly upset by Mr. Hawkins's
line = 1539 | 1 | death." He interrupted:--
line = 1540 | 1 | 
line = 1541 | 1 | "Oh, yes, I know, I know. I have read your last two letters." I went
line = 1542 | 1 | on:--
line = 1543 | 1 | 
line = 1544 | 1 | "I suppose this upset him, for when we were in town on Thursday last he
line = 1545 | 1 | had a sort of shock."
line = 1546 | 1 | 
line = 1547 | 1 | "A shock, and after brain fever so soon! That was not good. What kind of
line = 1548 | 1 | a shock was it?"
line = 1549 | 1 | 
line = 1550 | 1 | "He thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible, something
line = 1551 | 1 | which led to his brain fever." And here the whole thing seemed to
line = 1552 | 1 | overwhelm me in a rush. The pity for Jonathan, the horror which he
line = 1553 | 1 | experienced, the whole fearful mystery of his diary, and the fear that
line = 1554 | 1 | has been brooding over me ever since, all came in a tumult. I suppose I
line = 1555 | 1 | was hysterical, for I threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to
line = 1556 | 1 | him, and implored him to make my husband well again. He took my hands
line = 1557 | 1 | and raised me up, and made me sit on the sofa, and sat by me; he held my
line = 1558 | 1 | hand in his, and said to me with, oh, such infinite sweetness:--
line = 1559 | 1 | 
line = 1560 | 1 | "My life is a barren and lonely one, and so full of work that I have not
line = 1561 | 1 | had much time for friendships; but since I have been summoned to here by
line = 1562 | 1 | my friend John Seward I have known so many good people and seen such
line = 1563 | 1 | nobility that I feel more than ever--and it has grown with my advancing
line = 1564 | 1 | years--the loneliness of my life. Believe, me, then, that I come here
line = 1565 | 1 | full of respect for you, and you have given me hope--hope, not in what I
line = 1566 | 1 | am seeking of, but that there are good women still left to make life
line = 1567 | 1 | happy--good women, whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for
line = 1568 | 1 | the children that are to be. I am glad, glad, that I may here be of some
line = 1569 | 1 | use to you; for if your husband suffer, he suffer within the range of my
line = 1570 | 1 | study and experience. I promise you that I will gladly do _all_ for him
line = 1571 | 1 | that I can--all to make his life strong and manly, and your life a happy
line = 1572 | 1 | one. Now you must eat. You are overwrought and perhaps over-anxious.
line = 1573 | 1 | Husband Jonathan would not like to see you so pale; and what he like not
line = 1574 | 1 | where he love, is not to his good. Therefore for his sake you must eat
line = 1575 | 1 | and smile. You have told me all about Lucy, and so now we shall not
line = 1576 | 1 | speak of it, lest it distress. I shall stay in Exeter to-night, for I
line = 1577 | 1 | want to think much over what you have told me, and when I have thought I
line = 1578 | 1 | will ask you questions, if I may. And then, too, you will tell me of
line = 1579 | 1 | husband Jonathan's trouble so far as you can, but not yet. You must eat
line = 1580 | 1 | now; afterwards you shall tell me all."
line = 1581 | 1 | 
line = 1582 | 1 | After lunch, when we went back to the drawing-room, he said to me:--
line = 1583 | 1 | 
line = 1584 | 1 | "And now tell me all about him." When it came to speaking to this great
line = 1585 | 1 | learned man, I began to fear that he would think me a weak fool, and
line = 1586 | 1 | Jonathan a madman--that journal is all so strange--and I hesitated to go
line = 1587 | 1 | on. But he was so sweet and kind, and he had promised to help, and I
line = 1588 | 1 | trusted him, so I said:--
line = 1589 | 1 | 
line = 1590 | 1 | "Dr. Van Helsing, what I have to tell you is so queer that you must not
line = 1591 | 1 | laugh at me or at my husband. I have been since yesterday in a sort of
line = 1592 | 1 | fever of doubt; you must be kind to me, and not think me foolish that I
line = 1593 | 1 | have even half believed some very strange things." He reassured me by
line = 1594 | 1 | his manner as well as his words when he said:--
line = 1595 | 1 | 
line = 1596 | 1 | "Oh, my dear, if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which
line = 1597 | 1 | I am here, it is you who would laugh. I have learned not to think little
line = 1598 | 1 | of any one's belief, no matter how strange it be. I have tried to keep
line = 1599 | 1 | an open mind; and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close
line = 1600 | 1 | it, but the strange things, the extraordinary things, the things that
line = 1601 | 1 | make one doubt if they be mad or sane."
line = 1602 | 1 | 
line = 1603 | 1 | "Thank you, thank you, a thousand times! You have taken a weight off my
line = 1604 | 1 | mind. If you will let me, I shall give you a paper to read. It is long,
line = 1605 | 1 | but I have typewritten it out. It will tell you my trouble and
line = 1606 | 1 | Jonathan's. It is the copy of his journal when abroad, and all that
line = 1607 | 1 | happened. I dare not say anything of it; you will read for yourself and
line = 1608 | 1 | judge. And then when I see you, perhaps, you will be very kind and tell
line = 1609 | 1 | me what you think."
line = 1610 | 1 | 
line = 1611 | 1 | "I promise," he said as I gave him the papers; "I shall in the morning,
line = 1612 | 1 | so soon as I can, come to see you and your husband, if I may."
line = 1613 | 1 | 
line = 1614 | 1 | "Jonathan will be here at half-past eleven, and you must come to lunch
line = 1615 | 1 | with us and see him then; you could catch the quick 3:34 train, which
line = 1616 | 1 | will leave you at Paddington before eight." He was surprised at my
line = 1617 | 1 | knowledge of the trains off-hand, but he does not know that I have made
line = 1618 | 1 | up all the trains to and from Exeter, so that I may help Jonathan in
line = 1619 | 1 | case he is in a hurry.
line = 1620 | 1 | 
line = 1621 | 1 | So he took the papers with him and went away, and I sit here

line = 1672 | 1 | 
line = 1673 | 1 | 
line = 1674 | 1 | _Jonathan Harker's Journal._
line = 1675 | 1 | 
line = 1676 | 1 | _26 September._--I thought never to write in this diary again, but the
line = 1677 | 1 | time has come. When I got home last night Mina had supper ready, and
line = 1678 | 1 | when we had supped she told me of Van Helsing's visit, and of her having
line = 1679 | 1 | given him the two diaries copied out, and of how anxious she has been
line = 1680 | 1 | about me. She showed me in the doctor's letter that all I wrote down was
line = 1681 | 1 | true. It seems to have made a new man of me. It was the doubt as to the
line = 1682 | 1 | reality of the whole thing that knocked me over. I felt impotent, and in
line = 1683 | 1 | the dark, and distrustful. But, now that I _know_, I am not afraid, even
line = 1684 | 1 | of the Count. He has succeeded after all, then, in his design in getting
line = 1685 | 1 | to London, and it was he I saw. He has got younger, and how? Van Helsing
line = 1686 | 1 | is the man to unmask him and hunt him out, if he is anything like what
line = 1687 | 1 | Mina says. We sat late, and talked it all over. Mina is dressing, and I
line = 1688 | 1 | shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over....
line = 1689 | 1 | 
line = 1690 | 1 | He was, I think, surprised to see me. When I came into the room where he
line = 1691 | 1 | was, and introduced myself, he took me by the shoulder, and turned my
line = 1692 | 1 | face round to the light, and said, after a sharp scrutiny:--
line = 1693 | 1 | 
line = 1694 | 1 | "But Madam Mina told me you were ill, that you had had a shock." It was
line = 1695 | 1 | so funny to hear my wife called "Madam Mina" by this kindly,
line = 1696 | 1 | strong-faced old man. I smiled, and said:--
line = 1697 | 1 | 
line = 1698 | 1 | "I _was_ ill, I _have_ had a shock; but you have cured me already."
line = 1699 | 1 | 
line = 1700 | 1 | "And how?"
line = 1701 | 1 | 
line = 1702 | 1 | "By your letter to Mina last night. I was in doubt, and then everything
line = 1703 | 1 | took a hue of unreality, and I did not know what to trust, even the
line = 1704 | 1 | evidence of my own senses. Not knowing what to trust, I did not know
line = 1705 | 1 | what to do; and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been
line = 1706 | 1 | the groove of my life. The groove ceased to avail me, and I mistrusted
line = 1707 | 1 | myself. Doctor, you don't know what it is to doubt everything, even
line = 1708 | 1 | yourself. No, you don't; you couldn't with eyebrows like yours." He
line = 1709 | 1 | seemed pleased, and laughed as he said:--
line = 1710 | 1 | 
line = 1711 | 1 | "So! You are physiognomist. I learn more here with each hour. I am with
line = 1712 | 1 | so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast; and, oh, sir, you will
line = 1713 | 1 | pardon praise from an old man, but you are blessed in your wife." I
line = 1714 | 1 | would listen to him go on praising Mina for a day, so I simply nodded
line = 1715 | 1 | and stood silent.
line = 1716 | 1 | 
line = 1717 | 1 | "She is one of God's women, fashioned by His own hand to show us men and
line = 1718 | 1 | other women that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its
line = 1719 | 1 | light can be here on earth. So true, so sweet, so noble, so little an
line = 1720 | 1 | egoist--and that, let me tell you, is much in this age, so sceptical and
line = 1721 | 1 | selfish. And you, sir--I have read all the letters to poor Miss Lucy,
line = 1722 | 1 | and some of them speak of you, so I know you since some days from the
line = 1723 | 1 | knowing of others; but I have seen your true self since last night. You
line = 1724 | 1 | will give me your hand, will you not? And let us be friends for all our
line = 1725 | 1 | lives."
line = 1726 | 1 | 
line = 1727 | 1 | We shook hands, and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite
line = 1728 | 1 | choky.
line = 1729 | 1 | 
line = 1730 | 1 | "And now," he said, "may I ask you for some more help? I have a great
line = 1731 | 1 | task to do, and at the beginning it is to know. You can help me here.
line = 1732 | 1 | Can you tell me what went before your going to Transylvania? Later on I
line = 1733 | 1 | may ask more help, and of a different kind; but at first this will do."
line = 1734 | 1 | 
line = 1735 | 1 | "Look here, sir," I said, "does what you have to do concern the Count?"
line = 1736 | 1 | 
line = 1737 | 1 | "It does," he said solemnly.
line = 1738 | 1 | 
line = 1739 | 1 | "Then I am with you heart and soul. As you go by the 10:30 train, you
line = 1740 | 1 | will not have time to read them; but I shall get the bundle of papers.
line = 1741 | 1 | You can take them with you and read them in the train."
line = 1742 | 1 | 
line = 1743 | 1 | After breakfast I saw him to the station. When we were parting he
line = 1744 | 1 | said:--
line = 1745 | 1 | 
line = 1746 | 1 | "Perhaps you will come to town if I send to you, and take Madam Mina
line = 1747 | 1 | too."
line = 1748 | 1 | 
line = 1749 | 1 | "We shall both come when you will," I said.
line = 1750 | 1 | 
line = 1751 | 1 | I had got him the morning papers and the London papers of the previous
line = 1752 | 1 | night, and while we were talking at the carriage window, waiting for the
line = 1753 | 1 | train to start, he was turning them over. His eyes suddenly seemed to
line = 1754 | 1 | catch something in one of them, "The Westminster Gazette"--I knew it by
line = 1755 | 1 | the colour--and he grew quite white. He read something intently,
line = 1756 | 1 | groaning to himself: "Mein Gott! Mein Gott! So soon! so soon!" I do not
line = 1757 | 1 | think he remembered me at the moment. Just then the whistle blew, and
line = 1758 | 1 | the train moved off. This recalled him to himself, and he leaned out of
line = 1759 | 1 | the window and waved his hand, calling out: "Love to Madam Mina; I shall
line = 1760 | 1 | write so soon as ever I can."
line = 1761 | 1 | 
line = 1762 | 1 | 
line = 1763 | 1 | _Dr. Seward's Diary._
line = 1764 | 1 | 
line = 1765 | 1 | _26 September._--Truly there is no such thing as finality. Not a week
line = 1766 | 1 | since I said "Finis," and yet here I am starting fresh again, or rather
line = 1767 | 1 | going on with the same record. Until this afternoon I had no cause to
line = 1768 | 1 | think of what is done. Renfield had become, to all intents, as sane as
line = 1769 | 1 | he ever was. He was already well ahead with his fly business; and he had
line = 1770 | 1 | just started in the spider line also; so he had not been of any trouble
line = 1771 | 1 | to me. I had a letter from Arthur, written on Sunday, and from it I
line = 1772 | 1 | gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well. Quincey Morris is with
line = 1773 | 1 | him, and that is much of a help, for he himself is a bubbling well of
line = 1774 | 1 | good spirits. Quincey wrote me a line too, and from him I hear that
line = 1775 | 1 | Arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy; so as to
line = 1776 | 1 | them all my mind is at rest. As for myself, I was settling down to my
line = 1777 | 1 | work with the enthusiasm which I used to have for it, so that I might
line = 1778 | 1 | fairly have said that the wound which poor Lucy left on me was becoming
line = 1779 | 1 | cicatrised. Everything is, however, now reopened; and what is to be the
line = 1780 | 1 | end God only knows. I have an idea that Van Helsing thinks he knows,
line = 1781 | 1 | too, but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity. He
line = 1782 | 1 | went to Exeter yesterday, and stayed there all night. To-day he came
line = 1783 | 1 | back, and almost bounded into the room at about half-past five o'clock,
line = 1784 | 1 | and thrust last night's "Westminster Gazette" into my hand.
line = 1785 | 1 | 
line = 1786 | 1 | "What do you think of that?" he asked as he stood back and folded his
line = 1787 | 1 | arms.
line = 1788 | 1 | 
line = 1789 | 1 | I looked over the paper, for I really did not know what he meant; but he
line = 1790 | 1 | took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed
line = 1791 | 1 | away at Hampstead. It did not convey much to me, until I reached a
line = 1792 | 1 | passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats. An
line = 1793 | 1 | idea struck me, and I looked up. "Well?" he said.
line = 1794 | 1 | 
line = 1795 | 1 | "It is like poor Lucy's."
line = 1796 | 1 | 
line = 1797 | 1 | "And what do you make of it?"
line = 1798 | 1 | 
line = 1799 | 1 | "Simply that there is some cause in common. Whatever it was that injured
line = 1800 | 1 | her has injured them." I did not quite understand his answer:--
line = 1801 | 1 | 
line = 1802 | 1 | "That is true indirectly, but not directly."
line = 1803 | 1 | 
line = 1804 | 1 | "How do you mean, Professor?" I asked. I was a little inclined to take
line = 1805 | 1 | his seriousness lightly--for, after all, four days of rest and freedom
line = 1806 | 1 | from burning, harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits--but
line = 1807 | 1 | when I saw his face, it sobered me. Never, even in the midst of our
line = 1808 | 1 | despair about poor Lucy, had he looked more stern.
line = 1809 | 1 | 
line = 1810 | 1 | "Tell me!" I said. "I can hazard no opinion. I do not know what to
line = 1811 | 1 | think, and I have no data on which to found a conjecture."
line = 1812 | 1 | 
line = 1813 | 1 | "Do you mean to tell me, friend John, that you have no suspicion as to
line = 1814 | 1 | what poor Lucy died of; not after all the hints given, not only by
line = 1815 | 1 | events, but by me?"
line = 1816 | 1 | 
line = 1817 | 1 | "Of nervous prostration following on great loss or waste of blood."
line = 1818 | 1 | 
line = 1819 | 1 | "And how the blood lost or waste?" I shook my head. He stepped over and
line = 1820 | 1 | sat down beside me, and went on:--
line = 1821 | 1 | 
line = 1822 | 1 | "You are clever man, friend John; you reason well, and your wit is bold;
line = 1823 | 1 | but you are too prejudiced. You do not let your eyes see nor your ears
line = 1824 | 1 | hear, and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to
line = 1825 | 1 | you. Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand,
line = 1826 | 1 | and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot? But
line = 1827 | 1 | there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by men's
line = 1828 | 1 | eyes, because they know--or think they know--some things which other men
line = 1829 | 1 | have told them. Ah, it is the fault of our science that it wants to
line = 1830 | 1 | explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to
line = 1831 | 1 | explain. But yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs,
line = 1832 | 1 | which think themselves new; and which are yet but the old, which pretend
line = 1833 | 1 | to be young--like the fine ladies at the opera. I suppose now you do not
line = 1834 | 1 | believe in corporeal transference. No? Nor in materialisation. No? Nor
line = 1835 | 1 | in astral bodies. No? Nor in the reading of thought. No? Nor in
line = 1836 | 1 | hypnotism----"
line = 1837 | 1 | 
line = 1838 | 1 | "Yes," I said. "Charcot has proved that pretty well." He smiled as he
line = 1839 | 1 | went on: "Then you are satisfied as to it. Yes? And of course then you
line = 1840 | 1 | understand how it act, and can follow the mind of the great
line = 1841 | 1 | Charcot--alas that he is no more!--into the very soul of the patient
line = 1842 | 1 | that he influence. No? Then, friend John, am I to take it that you
line = 1843 | 1 | simply accept fact, and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion
line = 1844 | 1 | be a blank? No? Then tell me--for I am student of the brain--how you
line = 1845 | 1 | accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading. Let me tell you, my
line = 1846 | 1 | friend, that there are things done to-day in electrical science which
line = 1847 | 1 | would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered
line = 1848 | 1 | electricity--who would themselves not so long before have been burned
line = 1849 | 1 | as wizards. There are always mysteries in life. Why was it that
line = 1850 | 1 | Methuselah lived nine hundred years, and 'Old Parr' one hundred and
line = 1851 | 1 | sixty-nine, and yet that poor Lucy, with four men's blood in her poor
line = 1852 | 1 | veins, could not live even one day? For, had she live one more day, we
line = 1853 | 1 | could have save her. Do you know all the mystery of life and death? Do
line = 1854 | 1 | you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the
line = 1855 | 1 | qualities of brutes are in some men, and not in others? Can you tell me
line = 1856 | 1 | why, when other spiders die small and soon, that one great spider lived
line = 1857 | 1 | for centuries in the tower of the old Spanish church and grew and grew,
line = 1858 | 1 | till, on descending, he could drink the oil of all the church lamps? Can
line = 1859 | 1 | you tell me why in the Pampas, ay and elsewhere, there are bats that
line = 1860 | 1 | come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their
line = 1861 | 1 | veins; how in some islands of the Western seas there are bats which hang
line = 1862 | 1 | on the trees all day, and those who have seen describe as like giant
line = 1863 | 1 | nuts or pods, and that when the sailors sleep on the deck, because that
line = 1864 | 1 | it is hot, flit down on them, and then--and then in the morning are
line = 1865 | 1 | found dead men, white as even Miss Lucy was?"
line = 1866 | 1 | 
line = 1867 | 1 | "Good God, Professor!" I said, starting up. "Do you mean to tell me that
line = 1868 | 1 | Lucy was bitten by such a bat; and that such a thing is here in London
line = 1869 | 1 | in the nineteenth century?" He waved his hand for silence, and went
line = 1870 | 1 | on:--
line = 1871 | 1 | 
line = 1872 | 1 | "Can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of
line = 1873 | 1 | men; why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties; and
line = 1874 | 1 | why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint?
line = 1875 | 1 | Can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are
line = 1876 | 1 | some few who live on always if they be permit; that there are men and
line = 1877 | 1 | women who cannot die? We all know--because science has vouched for the
line = 1878 | 1 | fact--that there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of
line = 1879 | 1 | years, shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of
line = 1880 | 1 | the world. Can you tell me how the Indian fakir can make himself to die
line = 1881 | 1 | and have been buried, and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it, and the
line = 1882 | 1 | corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again, and then men
line = 1883 | 1 | come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the Indian
line = 1884 | 1 | fakir, not dead, but that rise up and walk amongst them as before?" Here
line = 1885 | 1 | I interrupted him. I was getting bewildered; he so crowded on my mind
line = 1886 | 1 | his list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my
line = 1887 | 1 | imagination was getting fired. I had a dim idea that he was teaching me
line = 1888 | 1 | some lesson, as long ago he used to do in his study at Amsterdam; but
line = 1889 | 1 | he used then to tell me the thing, so that I could have the object of
line = 1890 | 1 | thought in mind all the time. But now I was without this help, yet I
line = 1891 | 1 | wanted to follow him, so I said:--
line = 1892 | 1 | 
line = 1893 | 1 | "Professor, let me be your pet student again. Tell me the thesis, so
line = 1894 | 1 | that I may apply your knowledge as you go on. At present I am going in
line = 1895 | 1 | my mind from point to point as a mad man, and not a sane one, follows an
line = 1896 | 1 | idea. I feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist, jumping
line = 1897 | 1 | from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without
line = 1898 | 1 | knowing where I am going."
line = 1899 | 1 | 
line = 1900 | 1 | "That is good image," he said. "Well, I shall tell you. My thesis is
line = 1901 | 1 | this: I want you to believe."
line = 1902 | 1 | 
line = 1903 | 1 | "To believe what?"
line = 1904 | 1 | 
line = 1905 | 1 | "To believe in things that you cannot. Let me illustrate. I heard once
line = 1906 | 1 | of an American who so defined faith: 'that faculty which enables us to
line = 1907 | 1 | believe things which we know to be untrue.' For one, I follow that man.
line = 1908 | 1 | He meant that we shall have an open mind, and not let a little bit of
line = 1909 | 1 | truth check the rush of a big truth, like a small rock does a railway
line = 1910 | 1 | truck. We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value
line = 1911 | 1 | him; but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in
line = 1912 | 1 | the universe."
line = 1913 | 1 | 
line = 1914 | 1 | "Then you want me not to let some previous conviction injure the
line = 1915 | 1 | receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter. Do I read
line = 1916 | 1 | your lesson aright?"
line = 1917 | 1 | 
line = 1918 | 1 | "Ah, you are my favourite pupil still. It is worth to teach you. Now
line = 1919 | 1 | that you are willing to understand, you have taken the first step to
line = 1920 | 1 | understand. You think then that those so small holes in the children's
line = 1921 | 1 | throats were made by the same that made the hole in Miss Lucy?"
line = 1922 | 1 | 
line = 1923 | 1 | "I suppose so." He stood up and said solemnly:--
line = 1924 | 1 | 
line = 1925 | 1 | "Then you are wrong. Oh, would it were so! but alas! no. It is worse,
line = 1926 | 1 | far, far worse."
line = 1927 | 1 | 
line = 1928 | 1 | "In God's name, Professor Van Helsing, what do you mean?" I cried.
line = 1929 | 1 | 
line = 1930 | 1 | He threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair, and placed his
line = 1931 | 1 | elbows on the table, covering his face with his hands as he spoke:--
line = 1932 | 1 | 
line = 1933 | 1 | "They were made by Miss Lucy!"
line = 1934 | 1 | 
line = 1935 | 1 |

line = 1938 | 1 | CHAPTER XV

line = 1940 | 1 | DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_.
line = 1941 | 1 | 
line = 1942 | 1 | 
line = 1943 | 1 | For a while sheer anger mastered me; it was as if he had during her life
line = 1944 | 1 | struck Lucy on the face. I smote the table hard and rose up as I said to
line = 1945 | 1 | him:--
line = 1946 | 1 | 
line = 1947 | 1 | "Dr. Van Helsing, are you mad?" He raised his head and looked at me, and
line = 1948 | 1 | somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once. "Would I were!" he
line = 1949 | 1 | said. "Madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this. Oh, my
line = 1950 | 1 | friend, why, think you, did I go so far round, why take so long to tell
line = 1951 | 1 | you so simple a thing? Was it because I hate you and have hated you all
line = 1952 | 1 | my life? Was it because I wished to give you pain? Was it that I wanted,
line = 1953 | 1 | now so late, revenge for that time when you saved my life, and from a
line = 1954 | 1 | fearful death? Ah no!"
line = 1955 | 1 | 
line = 1956 | 1 | "Forgive me," said I. He went on:--
line = 1957 | 1 | 
line = 1958 | 1 | "My friend, it was because I wished to be gentle in the breaking to you,
line = 1959 | 1 | for I know you have loved that so sweet lady. But even yet I do not
line = 1960 | 1 | expect you to believe. It is so hard to accept at once any abstract
line = 1961 | 1 | truth, that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always
line = 1962 | 1 | believed the 'no' of it; it is more hard still to accept so sad a
line = 1963 | 1 | concrete truth, and of such a one as Miss Lucy. To-night I go to prove
line = 1964 | 1 | it. Dare you come with me?"
line = 1965 | 1 | 
line = 1966 | 1 | This staggered me. A man does not like to prove such a truth; Byron
line = 1967 | 1 | excepted from the category, jealousy.
line = 1968 | 1 | 
line = 1969 | 1 |     "And prove the very truth he most abhorred."
line = 1970 | 1 | 
line = 1971 | 1 | He saw my hesitation, and spoke:--
line = 1972 | 1 | 
line = 1973 | 1 | "The logic is simple, no madman's logic this time, jumping from tussock
line = 1974 | 1 | to tussock in a misty bog. If it be not true, then proof will be relief;
line = 1975 | 1 | at worst it will not harm. If it be true! Ah, there is the dread; yet
line = 1976 | 1 | very dread should help my cause, for in it is some need of belief. Come,
line = 1977 | 1 | I tell you what I propose: first, that we go off now and see that child
line = 1978 | 1 | in the hospital. Dr. Vincent, of the North Hospital, where the papers
line = 1979 | 1 | say the child is, is friend of mine, and I think of yours since you were
line = 1980 | 1 | in class at Amsterdam. He will let two scientists see his case, if he
line = 1981 | 1 | will not let two friends. We shall tell him nothing, but only that we
line = 1982 | 1 | wish to learn. And then----"
line = 1983 | 1 | 
line = 1984 | 1 | "And then?" He took a key from his pocket and held it up. "And then we
line = 1985 | 1 | spend the night, you and I, in the churchyard where Lucy lies. This is
line = 1986 | 1 | the key that lock the tomb. I had it from the coffin-man to give to
line = 1987 | 1 | Arthur." My heart sank within me, for I felt that there was some fearful
line = 1988 | 1 | ordeal before us. I could do nothing, however, so I plucked up what
line = 1989 | 1 | heart I could and said that we had better hasten, as the afternoon was
line = 1990 | 1 | passing....
line = 1991 | 1 | 
line = 1992 | 1 | We found the child awake. It had had a sleep and taken some food, and
line = 1993 | 1 | altogether was going on well. Dr. Vincent took the bandage from its
line = 1994 | 1 | throat, and showed us the punctures. There was no mistaking the
line = 1995 | 1 | similarity to those which had been on Lucy's throat. They were smaller,
line = 1996 | 1 | and the edges looked fresher; that was all. We asked Vincent to what he
line = 1997 | 1 | attributed them, and he replied that it must have been a bite of some
line = 1998 | 1 | animal, perhaps a rat; but, for his own part, he was inclined to think
line = 1999 | 1 | that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern
line = 2000 | 1 | heights of London. "Out of so many harmless ones," he said, "there may
line = 2001 | 1 | be some wild specimen from the South of a more malignant species. Some
line = 2002 | 1 | sailor may have brought one home, and it managed to escape; or even from
line = 2003 | 1 | the Zoölogical Gardens a young one may have got loose, or one be bred
line = 2004 | 1 | there from a vampire. These things do occur, you know. Only ten days ago
line = 2005 | 1 | a wolf got out, and was, I believe, traced up in this direction. For a
line = 2006 | 1 | week after, the children were playing nothing but Red Riding Hood on the
line = 2007 | 1 | Heath and in every alley in the place until this 'bloofer lady' scare
line = 2008 | 1 | came along, since when it has been quite a gala-time with them. Even
line = 2009 | 1 | this poor little mite, when he woke up to-day, asked the nurse if he
line = 2010 | 1 | might go away. When she asked him why he wanted to go, he said he wanted
line = 2011 | 1 | to play with the 'bloofer lady.'"
line = 2012 | 1 | 
line = 2013 | 1 | "I hope," said Van Helsing, "that when you are sending the child home
line = 2014 | 1 | you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it. These fancies
line = 2015 | 1 | to stray are most dangerous; and if the child were to remain out another
line = 2016 | 1 | night, it would probably be fatal. But in any case I suppose you will
line = 2017 | 1 | not let it away for some days?"
line = 2018 | 1 | 
line = 2019 | 1 | "Certainly not, not for a week at least; longer if the wound is not
line = 2020 | 1 | healed."
line = 2021 | 1 | 
line = 2022 | 1 | Our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on, and
line = 2023 | 1 | the sun had dipped before we came out. When Van Helsing saw how dark it
line = 2024 | 1 | was, he said:--
line = 2025 | 1 | 
line = 2026 | 1 | "There is no hurry. It is more late than I thought. Come, let us seek
line = 2027 | 1 | somewhere that we may eat, and then we shall go on our way."
line = 2028 | 1 | 
line = 2029 | 1 | We dined at "Jack Straw's Castle" along with a little crowd of
line = 2030 | 1 | bicyclists and others who were genially noisy. About ten o'clock we
line = 2031 | 1 | started from the inn. It was then very dark, and the scattered lamps
line = 2032 | 1 | made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual
line = 2033 | 1 | radius. The Professor had evidently noted the road we were to go, for he
line = 2034 | 1 | went on unhesitatingly; but, as for me, I was in quite a mixup as to
line = 2035 | 1 | locality. As we went further, we met fewer and fewer people, till at
line = 2036 | 1 | last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse
line = 2037 | 1 | police going their usual suburban round. At last we reached the wall of
line = 2038 | 1 | the churchyard, which we climbed over. With some little difficulty--for
line = 2039 | 1 | it was very dark, and the whole place seemed so strange to us--we found
line = 2040 | 1 | the Westenra tomb. The Professor took the key, opened the creaky door,
line = 2041 | 1 | and standing back, politely, but quite unconsciously, motioned me to
line = 2042 | 1 | precede him. There was a delicious irony in the offer, in the
line = 2043 | 1 | courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion. My
line = 2044 | 1 | companion followed me quickly, and cautiously drew the door to, after
line = 2045 | 1 | carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling, and not a spring,
line = 2046 | 1 | one. In the latter case we should have been in a bad plight. Then he
line = 2047 | 1 | fumbled in his bag, and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle,
line = 2048 | 1 | proceeded to make a light. The tomb in the day-time, and when wreathed
line = 2049 | 1 | with fresh flowers, had looked grim and gruesome enough; but now, some
line = 2050 | 1 | days afterwards, when the flowers hung lank and dead, their whites
line = 2051 | 1 | turning to rust and their greens to browns; when the spider and the
line = 2052 | 1 | beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance; when time-discoloured
line = 2053 | 1 | stone, and dust-encrusted mortar, and rusty, dank iron, and tarnished
line = 2054 | 1 | brass, and clouded silver-plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a
line = 2055 | 1 | candle, the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been
line = 2056 | 1 | imagined. It conveyed irresistibly the idea that life--animal life--was
line = 2057 | 1 | not the only thing which could pass away.
line = 2058 | 1 | 
line = 2059 | 1 | Van Helsing went about his work systematically. Holding his candle so
line = 2060 | 1 | that he could read the coffin plates, and so holding it that the sperm
line = 2061 | 1 | dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal, he
line = 2062 | 1 | made assurance of Lucy's coffin. Another search in his bag, and he took
line = 2063 | 1 | out a turnscrew.
line = 2064 | 1 | 
line = 2065 | 1 | "What are you going to do?" I asked.
line = 2066 | 1 | 
line = 2067 | 1 | "To open the coffin. You shall yet be convinced." Straightway he began
line = 2068 | 1 | taking out the screws, and finally lifted off the lid, showing the
line = 2069 | 1 | casing of lead beneath. The sight was almost too much for me. It seemed
line = 2070 | 1 | to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have
line = 2071 | 1 | stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living; I actually took
line = 2072 | 1 | hold of his hand to stop him. He only said: "You shall see," and again
line = 2073 | 1 | fumbling in his bag, took out a tiny fret-saw. Striking the turnscrew
line = 2074 | 1 | through the lead with a swift downward stab, which made me wince, he
line = 2075 | 1 | made a small hole, which was, however, big enough to admit the point of
line = 2076 | 1 | the saw. I had expected a rush of gas from the week-old corpse. We
line = 2077 | 1 | doctors, who have had to study our dangers, have to become accustomed to
line = 2078 | 1 | such things, and I drew back towards the door. But the Professor never
line = 2079 | 1 | stopped for a moment; he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of
line = 2080 | 1 | the lead coffin, and then across, and down the other side. Taking the
line = 2081 | 1 | edge of the loose flange, he bent it back towards the foot of the
line = 2082 | 1 | coffin, and holding up the candle into the aperture, motioned to me to
line = 2083 | 1 | look.
line = 2084 | 1 | 
line = 2085 | 1 | I drew near and looked. The coffin was empty.
line = 2086 | 1 | 
line = 2087 | 1 | It was certainly a surprise to me, and gave me a considerable shock, but
line = 2088 | 1 | Van Helsing was unmoved. He was now more sure than ever of his ground,
line = 2089 | 1 | and so emboldened to proceed in his task. "Are you satisfied now, friend
line = 2090 | 1 | John?" he asked.
line = 2091 | 1 | 
line = 2092 | 1 | I felt all the dogged argumentativeness of my nature awake within me as
line = 2093 | 1 | I answered him:--
line = 2094 | 1 | 
line = 2095 | 1 | "I am satisfied that Lucy's body is not in that coffin; but that only
line = 2096 | 1 | proves one thing."
line = 2097 | 1 | 
line = 2098 | 1 | "And what is that, friend John?"
line = 2099 | 1 | 
line = 2100 | 1 | "That it is not there."
line = 2101 | 1 | 
line = 2102 | 1 | "That is good logic," he said, "so far as it goes. But how do you--how
line = 2103 | 1 | can you--account for it not being there?"
line = 2104 | 1 | 
line = 2105 | 1 | "Perhaps a body-snatcher," I suggested. "Some of the undertaker's people
line = 2106 | 1 | may have stolen it." I felt that I was speaking folly, and yet it was
line = 2107 | 1 | the only real cause which I could suggest. The Professor sighed. "Ah
line = 2108 | 1 | well!" he said, "we must have more proof. Come with me."
line = 2109 | 1 | 
line = 2110 | 1 | He put on the coffin-lid again, gathered up all his things and placed
line = 2111 | 1 | them in the bag, blew out the light, and placed the candle also in the
line = 2112 | 1 | bag. We opened the door, and went out. Behind us he closed the door and
line = 2113 | 1 | locked it. He handed me the key, saying: "Will you keep it? You had
line = 2114 | 1 | better be assured." I laughed--it was not a very cheerful laugh, I am
line = 2115 | 1 | bound to say--as I motioned him to keep it. "A key is nothing," I said;
line = 2116 | 1 | "there may be duplicates; and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock
line = 2117 | 1 | of that kind." He said nothing, but put the key in his pocket. Then he
line = 2118 | 1 | told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at
line = 2119 | 1 | the other. I took up my place behind a yew-tree, and I saw his dark
line = 2120 | 1 | figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my
line = 2121 | 1 | sight.
line = 2122 | 1 | 
line = 2123 | 1 | It was a lonely vigil. Just after I had taken my place I heard a distant
line = 2124 | 1 | clock strike twelve, and in time came one and two. I was chilled and
line = 2125 | 1 | unnerved, and angry with the Professor for taking me on such an errand
line = 2126 | 1 | and with myself for coming. I was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly
line = 2127 | 1 | observant, and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether I had
line = 2128 | 1 | a dreary, miserable time.
line = 2129 | 1 | 
line = 2130 | 1 | Suddenly, as I turned round, I thought I saw something like a white
line = 2131 | 1 | streak, moving between two dark yew-trees at the side of the churchyard
line = 2132 | 1 | farthest from the tomb; at the same time a dark mass moved from the
line = 2133 | 1 | Professor's side of the ground, and hurriedly went towards it. Then I
line = 2134 | 1 | too moved; but I had to go round headstones and railed-off tombs, and I
line = 2135 | 1 | stumbled over graves. The sky was overcast, and somewhere far off an
line = 2136 | 1 | early cock crew. A little way off, beyond a line of scattered
line = 2137 | 1 | juniper-trees, which marked the pathway to the church, a white, dim
line = 2138 | 1 | figure flitted in the direction of the tomb. The tomb itself was hidden
line = 2139 | 1 | by trees, and I could not see where the figure disappeared. I heard the
line = 2140 | 1 | rustle of actual movement where I had first seen the white figure, and
line = 2141 | 1 | coming over, found the Professor holding in his arms a tiny child. When
line = 2142 | 1 | he saw me he held it out to me, and said:--
line = 2143 | 1 | 
line = 2144 | 1 | "Are you satisfied now?"
line = 2145 | 1 | 
line = 2146 | 1 | "No," I said, in a way that I felt was aggressive.
line = 2147 | 1 | 
line = 2148 | 1 | "Do you not see the child?"
line = 2149 | 1 | 
line = 2150 | 1 | "Yes, it is a child, but who brought it here? And is it wounded?" I
line = 2151 | 1 | asked.
line = 2152 | 1 | 
line = 2153 | 1 | "We shall see," said the Professor, and with one impulse we took our way
line = 2154 | 1 | out of the churchyard, he carrying the sleeping child.
line = 2155 | 1 | 
line = 2156 | 1 | When we had got some little distance away, we went into a clump of
line = 2157 | 1 | trees, and struck a match, and looked at the child's throat. It was
line = 2158 | 1 | without a scratch or scar of any kind.
line = 2159 | 1 | 
line = 2160 | 1 | "Was I right?" I asked triumphantly.
line = 2161 | 1 | 
line = 2162 | 1 | "We were just in time," said the Professor thankfully.
line = 2163 | 1 | 
line = 2164 | 1 | We had now to decide what we were to do with the child, and so consulted
line = 2165 | 1 | about it. If we were to take it to a police-station we should have to
line = 2166 | 1 | give some account of our movements during the night; at least, we should
line = 2167 | 1 | have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child.
line = 2168 | 1 | So finally we decided that we would take it to the Heath, and when we
line = 2169 | 1 | heard a policeman coming, would leave it where he could not fail to find
line = 2170 | 1 | it; we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could. All fell out
line = 2171 | 1 | well. At the edge of Hampstead Heath we heard a policeman's heavy
line = 2172 | 1 | tramp, and laying the child on the pathway, we waited and watched until
line = 2173 | 1 | he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro. We heard his exclamation
line = 2174 | 1 | of astonishment, and then we went away silently. By good chance we got a
line = 2175 | 1 | cab near the "Spaniards," and drove to town.
line = 2176 | 1 | 
line = 2177 | 1 | I cannot sleep, so I make this entry. But I must try to get a few hours'
line = 2178 | 1 | sleep, as Van Helsing is to call for me at noon. He insists that I shall
line = 2179 | 1 | go with him on another expedition.
line = 2180 | 1 | 
line = 2181 | 1 |        *       *       *       *       *
line = 2182 | 1 | 
line = 2183 | 1 | _27 September._--It was two o'clock before we found a suitable
line = 2184 | 1 | opportunity for our attempt. The funeral held at noon was all completed,
line = 2185 | 1 | and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily
line = 2186 | 1 | away, when, looking carefully from behind a clump of alder-trees, we saw
line = 2187 | 1 | the sexton lock the gate after him. We knew then that we were safe till
line = 2188 | 1 | morning did we desire it; but the Professor told me that we should not
line = 2189 | 1 | want more than an hour at most. Again I felt that horrid sense of the
line = 2190 | 1 | reality of things, in which any effort of imagination seemed out of
line = 2191 | 1 | place; and I realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were
line = 2192 | 1 | incurring in our unhallowed work. Besides, I felt it was all so useless.
line = 2193 | 1 | Outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin, to see if a woman dead
line = 2194 | 1 | nearly a week were really dead, it now seemed the height of folly to
line = 2195 | 1 | open the tomb again, when we knew, from the evidence of our own
line = 2196 | 1 | eyesight, that the coffin was empty. I shrugged my shoulders, however,
line = 2197 | 1 | and rested silent, for Van Helsing had a way of going on his own road,
line = 2198 | 1 | no matter who remonstrated. He took the key, opened the vault, and again
line = 2199 | 1 | courteously motioned me to precede. The place was not so gruesome as
line = 2200 | 1 | last night, but oh, how unutterably mean-looking when the sunshine
line = 2201 | 1 | streamed in. Van Helsing walked over to Lucy's coffin, and I followed.
line = 2202 | 1 | He bent over and again forced back the leaden flange; and then a shock
line = 2203 | 1 | of surprise and dismay shot through me.
line = 2204 | 1 | 
line = 2205 | 1 | There lay Lucy, seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her
line = 2206 | 1 | funeral. She was, if possible, more radiantly beautiful than ever; and I
line = 2207 | 1 | could not believe that she was dead. The lips were red, nay redder than
line = 2208 | 1 | before; and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom.
line = 2209 | 1 | 
line = 2210 | 1 | "Is this a juggle?" I said to him.
line = 2211 | 1 | 
line = 2212 | 1 | "Are you convinced now?" said the Professor in response, and as he spoke
line = 2213 | 1 | he put over his hand, and in a way that made me shudder, pulled back the
line = 2214 | 1 | dead lips and showed the white teeth.
line = 2215 | 1 | 
line = 2216 | 1 | "See," he went on, "see, they are even sharper than before. With this
line = 2217 | 1 | and this"--and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below
line = 2218 | 1 | it--"the little children can be bitten. Are you of belief now, friend
line = 2219 | 1 | John?" Once more, argumentative hostility woke within me. I _could_ not
line = 2220 | 1 | accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested; so, with an attempt to
line = 2221 | 1 | argue of which I was even at the moment ashamed, I said:--
line = 2222 | 1 | 
line = 2223 | 1 | "She may have been placed here since last night."
line = 2224 | 1 | 
line = 2225 | 1 | "Indeed? That is so, and by whom?"
line = 2226 | 1 | 
line = 2227 | 1 | "I do not know. Some one has done it."
line = 2228 | 1 | 
line = 2229 | 1 | "And yet she has been dead one week. Most peoples in that time would not
line = 2230 | 1 | look so." I had no answer for this, so was silent. Van Helsing did not
line = 2231 | 1 | seem to notice my silence; at any rate, he showed neither chagrin nor
line = 2232 | 1 | triumph. He was looking intently at the face of the dead woman, raising
line = 2233 | 1 | the eyelids and looking at the eyes, and once more opening the lips and
line = 2234 | 1 | examining the teeth. Then he turned to me and said:--
line = 2235 | 1 | 
line = 2236 | 1 | "Here, there is one thing which is different from all recorded; here is
line = 2237 | 1 | some dual life that is not as the common. She was bitten by the vampire
line = 2238 | 1 | when she was in a trance, sleep-walking--oh, you start; you do not know
line = 2239 | 1 | that, friend John, but you shall know it all later--and in trance could
line = 2240 | 1 | he best come to take more blood. In trance she died, and in trance she
line = 2241 | 1 | is Un-Dead, too. So it is that she differ from all other. Usually when
line = 2242 | 1 | the Un-Dead sleep at home"--as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of
line = 2243 | 1 | his arm to designate what to a vampire was "home"--"their face show what
line = 2244 | 1 | they are, but this so sweet that was when she not Un-Dead she go back to
line = 2245 | 1 | the nothings of the common dead. There is no malign there, see, and so
line = 2246 | 1 | it make hard that I must kill her in her sleep." This turned my blood
line = 2247 | 1 | cold, and it began to dawn upon me that I was accepting Van Helsing's
line = 2248 | 1 | theories; but if she were really dead, what was there of terror in the
line = 2249 | 1 | idea of killing her? He looked up at me, and evidently saw the change in
line = 2250 | 1 | my face, for he said almost joyously:--
line = 2251 | 1 | 
line = 2252 | 1 | "Ah, you believe now?"
line = 2253 | 1 | 
line = 2254 | 1 | I answered: "Do not press me too hard all at once. I am willing to
line = 2255 | 1 | accept. How will you do this bloody work?"
line = 2256 | 1 | 
line = 2257 | 1 | "I shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic, and I shall
line = 2258 | 1 | drive a stake through her body." It made me shudder to think of so
line = 2259 | 1 | mutilating the body of the woman whom I had loved. And yet the feeling
line = 2260 | 1 | was not so strong as I had expected. I was, in fact, beginning to
line = 2261 | 1 | shudder at the presence of this being, this Un-Dead, as Van Helsing
line = 2262 | 1 | called it, and to loathe it. Is it possible that love is all subjective,
line = 2263 | 1 | or all objective?
line = 2264 | 1 | 
line = 2265 | 1 | I waited a considerable time for Van Helsing to begin, but he stood as
line = 2266 | 1 | if wrapped in thought. Presently he closed the catch of his bag with a
line = 2267 | 1 | snap, and said:--
line = 2268 | 1 | 
line = 2269 | 1 | "I have been thinking, and have made up my mind as to what is best. If I
line = 2270 | 1 | did simply follow my inclining I would do now, at this moment, what is
line = 2271 | 1 | to be done; but there are other things to follow, and things that are
line = 2272 | 1 | thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know. This is
line = 2273 | 1 | simple. She have yet no life taken, though that is of time; and to act
line = 2274 | 1 | now would be to take danger from her for ever. But then we may have to
line = 2275 | 1 | want Arthur, and how shall we tell him of this? If you, who saw the
line = 2276 | 1 | wounds on Lucy's throat, and saw the wounds so similar on the child's at
line = 2277 | 1 | the hospital; if you, who saw the coffin empty last night and full
line = 2278 | 1 | to-day with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more
line = 2279 | 1 | beautiful in a whole week, after she die--if you know of this and know
line = 2280 | 1 | of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard,
line = 2281 | 1 | and yet of your own senses you did not believe, how, then, can I expect
line = 2282 | 1 | Arthur, who know none of those things, to believe? He doubted me when I
line = 2283 | 1 | took him from her kiss when she was dying. I know he has forgiven me
line = 2284 | 1 | because in some mistaken idea I have done things that prevent him say
line = 2285 | 1 | good-bye as he ought; and he may think that in some more mistaken idea
line = 2286 | 1 | this woman was buried alive; and that in most mistake of all we have
line = 2287 | 1 | killed her. He will then argue back that it is we, mistaken ones, that
line = 2288 | 1 | have killed her by our ideas; and so he will be much unhappy always. Yet
line = 2289 | 1 | he never can be sure; and that is the worst of all. And he will
line = 2290 | 1 | sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive, and that will paint
line = 2291 | 1 | his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered; and again, he
line = 2292 | 1 | will think that we may be right, and that his so beloved was, after all,
line = 2293 | 1 | an Un-Dead. No! I told him once, and since then I learn much. Now, since
line = 2294 | 1 | I know it is all true, a hundred thousand times more do I know that he
line = 2295 | 1 | must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet. He, poor fellow,
line = 2296 | 1 | must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to
line = 2297 | 1 | him; then we can act for good all round and send him peace. My mind is
line = 2298 | 1 | made up. Let us go. You return home for to-night to your asylum, and see
line = 2299 | 1 | that all be well. As for me, I shall spend the night here in this
line = 2300 | 1 | churchyard in my own way. To-morrow night you will come to me to the
line = 2301 | 1 | Berkeley Hotel at ten of the clock. I shall send for Arthur to come too,
line = 2302 | 1 | and also that so fine young man of America that gave his blood. Later we
line = 2303 | 1 | shall all have work to do. I come with you so far as Piccadilly and
line = 2304 | 1 | there dine, for I must be back here before the sun set."
line = 2305 | 1 | 
line = 2306 | 1 | So we locked the tomb and came away, and got over the wall of the
line = 2307 | 1 | churchyard, which was not much of a task, and drove back to Piccadilly.

line = 2319 | 1 | "I write this in case anything should happen. I go alone to watch in
line = 2320 | 1 | that churchyard. It pleases me that the Un-Dead, Miss Lucy, shall not
line = 2321 | 1 | leave to-night, that so on the morrow night she may be more eager.
line = 2322 | 1 | Therefore I shall fix some things she like not--garlic and a
line = 2323 | 1 | crucifix--and so seal up the door of the tomb. She is young as Un-Dead,
line = 2324 | 1 | and will heed. Moreover, these are only to prevent her coming out; they
line = 2325 | 1 | may not prevail on her wanting to get in; for then the Un-Dead is
line = 2326 | 1 | desperate, and must find the line of least resistance, whatsoever it may
line = 2327 | 1 | be. I shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise,
line = 2328 | 1 | and if there be aught that may be learned I shall learn it. For Miss
line = 2329 | 1 | Lucy or from her, I have no fear; but that other to whom is there that
line = 2330 | 1 | she is Un-Dead, he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter.
line = 2331 | 1 | He is cunning, as I know from Mr. Jonathan and from the way that all
line = 2332 | 1 | along he have fooled us when he played with us for Miss Lucy's life, and
line = 2333 | 1 | we lost; and in many ways the Un-Dead are strong. He have always the
line = 2334 | 1 | strength in his hand of twenty men; even we four who gave our strength
line = 2335 | 1 | to Miss Lucy it also is all to him. Besides, he can summon his wolf and
line = 2336 | 1 | I know not what. So if it be that he come thither on this night he shall
line = 2337 | 1 | find me; but none other shall--until it be too late. But it may be that
line = 2338 | 1 | he will not attempt the place. There is no reason why he should; his
line = 2339 | 1 | hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the
line = 2340 | 1 | Un-Dead woman sleep, and the one old man watch.
line = 2341 | 1 | 
line = 2342 | 1 | "Therefore I write this in case.... Take the papers that are with this,

line = 2357 | 1 | ideas; but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on
line = 2358 | 1 | common sense. I have no doubt that he believes it all. I wonder if his
line = 2359 | 1 | mind can have become in any way unhinged. Surely there must be _some_
line = 2360 | 1 | rational explanation of all these mysterious things. Is it possible that
line = 2361 | 1 | the Professor can have done it himself? He is so abnormally clever that
line = 2362 | 1 | if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to
line = 2363 | 1 | some fixed idea in a wonderful way. I am loath to think it, and indeed
line = 2364 | 1 | it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that Van
line = 2365 | 1 | Helsing was mad; but anyhow I shall watch him carefully. I may get some

line = 2370 | 1 | _29 September, morning._.... Last night, at a little before ten o'clock,
line = 2371 | 1 | Arthur and Quincey came into Van Helsing's room; he told us all that he
line = 2372 | 1 | wanted us to do, but especially addressing himself to Arthur, as if all
line = 2373 | 1 | our wills were centred in his. He began by saying that he hoped we would
line = 2374 | 1 | all come with him too, "for," he said, "there is a grave duty to be done
line = 2375 | 1 | there. You were doubtless surprised at my letter?" This query was
line = 2376 | 1 | directly addressed to Lord Godalming.
line = 2377 | 1 | 
line = 2378 | 1 | "I was. It rather upset me for a bit. There has been so much trouble
line = 2379 | 1 | around my house of late that I could do without any more. I have been
line = 2380 | 1 | curious, too, as to what you mean. Quincey and I talked it over; but the
line = 2381 | 1 | more we talked, the more puzzled we got, till now I can say for myself
line = 2382 | 1 | that I'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything."
line = 2383 | 1 | 
line = 2384 | 1 | "Me too," said Quincey Morris laconically.
line = 2385 | 1 | 
line = 2386 | 1 | "Oh," said the Professor, "then you are nearer the beginning, both of
line = 2387 | 1 | you, than friend John here, who has to go a long way back before he can
line = 2388 | 1 | even get so far as to begin."
line = 2389 | 1 | 
line = 2390 | 1 | It was evident that he recognised my return to my old doubting frame of
line = 2391 | 1 | mind without my saying a word. Then, turning to the other two, he said
line = 2392 | 1 | with intense gravity:--
line = 2393 | 1 | 
line = 2394 | 1 | "I want your permission to do what I think good this night. It is, I
line = 2395 | 1 | know, much to ask; and when you know what it is I propose to do you will
line = 2396 | 1 | know, and only then, how much. Therefore may I ask that you promise me
line = 2397 | 1 | in the dark, so that afterwards, though you may be angry with me for a
line = 2398 | 1 | time--I must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may
line = 2399 | 1 | be--you shall not blame yourselves for anything."
line = 2400 | 1 | 
line = 2401 | 1 | "That's frank anyhow," broke in Quincey. "I'll answer for the Professor.
line = 2402 | 1 | I don't quite see his drift, but I swear he's honest; and that's good
line = 2403 | 1 | enough for me."
line = 2404 | 1 | 
line = 2405 | 1 | "I thank you, sir," said Van Helsing proudly. "I have done myself the
line = 2406 | 1 | honour of counting you one trusting friend, and such endorsement is dear
line = 2407 | 1 | to me." He held out a hand, which Quincey took.
line = 2408 | 1 | 
line = 2409 | 1 | Then Arthur spoke out:--
line = 2410 | 1 | 
line = 2411 | 1 | "Dr. Van Helsing, I don't quite like to 'buy a pig in a poke,' as they
line = 2412 | 1 | say in Scotland, and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman
line = 2413 | 1 | or my faith as a Christian is concerned, I cannot make such a promise.
line = 2414 | 1 | If you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of
line = 2415 | 1 | these two, then I give my consent at once; though for the life of me, I
line = 2416 | 1 | cannot understand what you are driving at."
line = 2417 | 1 | 
line = 2418 | 1 | "I accept your limitation," said Van Helsing, "and all I ask of you is
line = 2419 | 1 | that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine, you will first
line = 2420 | 1 | consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your
line = 2421 | 1 | reservations."
line = 2422 | 1 | 
line = 2423 | 1 | "Agreed!" said Arthur; "that is only fair. And now that the
line = 2424 | 1 | _pourparlers_ are over, may I ask what it is we are to do?"
line = 2425 | 1 | 
line = 2426 | 1 | "I want you to come with me, and to come in secret, to the churchyard at
line = 2427 | 1 | Kingstead."
line = 2428 | 1 | 
line = 2429 | 1 | Arthur's face fell as he said in an amazed sort of way:--
line = 2430 | 1 | 
line = 2431 | 1 | "Where poor Lucy is buried?" The Professor bowed. Arthur went on: "And
line = 2432 | 1 | when there?"
line = 2433 | 1 | 
line = 2434 | 1 | "To enter the tomb!" Arthur stood up.
line = 2435 | 1 | 
line = 2436 | 1 | "Professor, are you in earnest; or it is some monstrous joke? Pardon me,
line = 2437 | 1 | I see that you are in earnest." He sat down again, but I could see that
line = 2438 | 1 | he sat firmly and proudly, as one who is on his dignity. There was
line = 2439 | 1 | silence until he asked again:--
line = 2440 | 1 | 
line = 2441 | 1 | "And when in the tomb?"
line = 2442 | 1 | 
line = 2443 | 1 | "To open the coffin."
line = 2444 | 1 | 
line = 2445 | 1 | "This is too much!" he said, angrily rising again. "I am willing to be
line = 2446 | 1 | patient in all things that are reasonable; but in this--this desecration
line = 2447 | 1 | of the grave--of one who----" He fairly choked with indignation. The
line = 2448 | 1 | Professor looked pityingly at him.
line = 2449 | 1 | 
line = 2450 | 1 | "If I could spare you one pang, my poor friend," he said, "God knows I
line = 2451 | 1 | would. But this night our feet must tread in thorny paths; or later, and
line = 2452 | 1 | for ever, the feet you love must walk in paths of flame!"
line = 2453 | 1 | 
line = 2454 | 1 | Arthur looked up with set white face and said:--
line = 2455 | 1 | 
line = 2456 | 1 | "Take care, sir, take care!"
line = 2457 | 1 | 
line = 2458 | 1 | "Would it not be well to hear what I have to say?" said Van Helsing.
line = 2459 | 1 | "And then you will at least know the limit of my purpose. Shall I go
line = 2460 | 1 | on?"
line = 2461 | 1 | 
line = 2462 | 1 | "That's fair enough," broke in Morris.
line = 2463 | 1 | 
line = 2464 | 1 | After a pause Van Helsing went on, evidently with an effort:--
line = 2465 | 1 | 
line = 2466 | 1 | "Miss Lucy is dead; is it not so? Yes! Then there can be no wrong to
line = 2467 | 1 | her. But if she be not dead----"
line = 2468 | 1 | 
line = 2469 | 1 | Arthur jumped to his feet.
line = 2470 | 1 | 
line = 2471 | 1 | "Good God!" he cried. "What do you mean? Has there been any mistake; has
line = 2472 | 1 | she been buried alive?" He groaned in anguish that not even hope could
line = 2473 | 1 | soften.
line = 2474 | 1 | 
line = 2475 | 1 | "I did not say she was alive, my child; I did not think it. I go no
line = 2476 | 1 | further than to say that she might be Un-Dead."
line = 2477 | 1 | 
line = 2478 | 1 | "Un-Dead! Not alive! What do you mean? Is this all a nightmare, or what
line = 2479 | 1 | is it?"
line = 2480 | 1 | 
line = 2481 | 1 | "There are mysteries which men can only guess at, which age by age they
line = 2482 | 1 | may solve only in part. Believe me, we are now on the verge of one. But
line = 2483 | 1 | I have not done. May I cut off the head of dead Miss Lucy?"
line = 2484 | 1 | 
line = 2485 | 1 | "Heavens and earth, no!" cried Arthur in a storm of passion. "Not for
line = 2486 | 1 | the wide world will I consent to any mutilation of her dead body. Dr.
line = 2487 | 1 | Van Helsing, you try me too far. What have I done to you that you should
line = 2488 | 1 | torture me so? What did that poor, sweet girl do that you should want to
line = 2489 | 1 | cast such dishonour on her grave? Are you mad that speak such things, or
line = 2490 | 1 | am I mad to listen to them? Don't dare to think more of such a
line = 2491 | 1 | desecration; I shall not give my consent to anything you do. I have a
line = 2492 | 1 | duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage; and, by God, I shall do
line = 2493 | 1 | it!"
line = 2494 | 1 | 
line = 2495 | 1 | Van Helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated, and
line = 2496 | 1 | said, gravely and sternly:--
line = 2497 | 1 | 
line = 2498 | 1 | "My Lord Godalming, I, too, have a duty to do, a duty to others, a duty
line = 2499 | 1 | to you, a duty to the dead; and, by God, I shall do it! All I ask you
line = 2500 | 1 | now is that you come with me, that you look and listen; and if when
line = 2501 | 1 | later I make the same request you do not be more eager for its
line = 2502 | 1 | fulfilment even than I am, then--then I shall do my duty, whatever it
line = 2503 | 1 | may seem to me. And then, to follow of your Lordship's wishes I shall
line = 2504 | 1 | hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you, when and where
line = 2505 | 1 | you will." His voice broke a little, and he went on with a voice full of
line = 2506 | 1 | pity:--
line = 2507 | 1 | 
line = 2508 | 1 | "But, I beseech you, do not go forth in anger with me. In a long life of
line = 2509 | 1 | acts which were often not pleasant to do, and which sometimes did wring
line = 2510 | 1 | my heart, I have never had so heavy a task as now. Believe me that if
line = 2511 | 1 | the time comes for you to change your mind towards me, one look from
line = 2512 | 1 | you will wipe away all this so sad hour, for I would do what a man can
line = 2513 | 1 | to save you from sorrow. Just think. For why should I give myself so
line = 2514 | 1 | much of labour and so much of sorrow? I have come here from my own land
line = 2515 | 1 | to do what I can of good; at the first to please my friend John, and
line = 2516 | 1 | then to help a sweet young lady, whom, too, I came to love. For her--I
line = 2517 | 1 | am ashamed to say so much, but I say it in kindness--I gave what you
line = 2518 | 1 | gave; the blood of my veins; I gave it, I, who was not, like you, her
line = 2519 | 1 | lover, but only her physician and her friend. I gave to her my nights
line = 2520 | 1 | and days--before death, after death; and if my death can do her good
line = 2521 | 1 | even now, when she is the dead Un-Dead, she shall have it freely." He
line = 2522 | 1 | said this with a very grave, sweet pride, and Arthur was much affected
line = 2523 | 1 | by it. He took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice:--
line = 2524 | 1 | 
line = 2525 | 1 | "Oh, it is hard to think of it, and I cannot understand; but at least I
line = 2526 | 1 | shall go with you and wait."
line = 2527 | 1 |

line = 2533 | 1 | DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_
line = 2534 | 1 | 
line = 2535 | 1 | 
line = 2536 | 1 | It was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the
line = 2537 | 1 | churchyard over the low wall. The night was dark with occasional gleams
line = 2538 | 1 | of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across
line = 2539 | 1 | the sky. We all kept somehow close together, with Van Helsing slightly
line = 2540 | 1 | in front as he led the way. When we had come close to the tomb I looked
line = 2541 | 1 | well at Arthur, for I feared that the proximity to a place laden with so
line = 2542 | 1 | sorrowful a memory would upset him; but he bore himself well. I took it
line = 2543 | 1 | that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant
line = 2544 | 1 | to his grief. The Professor unlocked the door, and seeing a natural
line = 2545 | 1 | hesitation amongst us for various reasons, solved the difficulty by
line = 2546 | 1 | entering first himself. The rest of us followed, and he closed the door.
line = 2547 | 1 | He then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin. Arthur stepped
line = 2548 | 1 | forward hesitatingly; Van Helsing said to me:--
line = 2549 | 1 | 
line = 2550 | 1 | "You were with me here yesterday. Was the body of Miss Lucy in that
line = 2551 | 1 | coffin?"
line = 2552 | 1 | 
line = 2553 | 1 | "It was." The Professor turned to the rest saying:--
line = 2554 | 1 | 
line = 2555 | 1 | "You hear; and yet there is no one who does not believe with me." He
line = 2556 | 1 | took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin. Arthur
line = 2557 | 1 | looked on, very pale but silent; when the lid was removed he stepped
line = 2558 | 1 | forward. He evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin, or,
line = 2559 | 1 | at any rate, had not thought of it. When he saw the rent in the lead,
line = 2560 | 1 | the blood rushed to his face for an instant, but as quickly fell away
line = 2561 | 1 | again, so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness; he was still silent.
line = 2562 | 1 | Van Helsing forced back the leaden flange, and we all looked in and
line = 2563 | 1 | recoiled.
line = 2564 | 1 | 
line = 2565 | 1 | The coffin was empty!
line = 2566 | 1 | 
line = 2567 | 1 | For several minutes no one spoke a word. The silence was broken by
line = 2568 | 1 | Quincey Morris:--
line = 2569 | 1 | 
line = 2570 | 1 | "Professor, I answered for you. Your word is all I want. I wouldn't ask
line = 2571 | 1 | such a thing ordinarily--I wouldn't so dishonour you as to imply a
line = 2572 | 1 | doubt; but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour.
line = 2573 | 1 | Is this your doing?"
line = 2574 | 1 | 
line = 2575 | 1 | "I swear to you by all that I hold sacred that I have not removed nor
line = 2576 | 1 | touched her. What happened was this: Two nights ago my friend Seward and
line = 2577 | 1 | I came here--with good purpose, believe me. I opened that coffin, which
line = 2578 | 1 | was then sealed up, and we found it, as now, empty. We then waited, and
line = 2579 | 1 | saw something white come through the trees. The next day we came here in
line = 2580 | 1 | day-time, and she lay there. Did she not, friend John?"
line = 2581 | 1 | 
line = 2582 | 1 | "Yes."
line = 2583 | 1 | 
line = 2584 | 1 | "That night we were just in time. One more so small child was missing,
line = 2585 | 1 | and we find it, thank God, unharmed amongst the graves. Yesterday I came
line = 2586 | 1 | here before sundown, for at sundown the Un-Dead can move. I waited here
line = 2587 | 1 | all the night till the sun rose, but I saw nothing. It was most probable
line = 2588 | 1 | that it was because I had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic,
line = 2589 | 1 | which the Un-Dead cannot bear, and other things which they shun. Last
line = 2590 | 1 | night there was no exodus, so to-night before the sundown I took away my
line = 2591 | 1 | garlic and other things. And so it is we find this coffin empty. But
line = 2592 | 1 | bear with me. So far there is much that is strange. Wait you with me
line = 2593 | 1 | outside, unseen and unheard, and things much stranger are yet to be.
line = 2594 | 1 | So"--here he shut the dark slide of his lantern--"now to the outside."
line = 2595 | 1 | He opened the door, and we filed out, he coming last and locking the
line = 2596 | 1 | door behind him.
line = 2597 | 1 | 
line = 2598 | 1 | Oh! but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of
line = 2599 | 1 | that vault. How sweet it was to see the clouds race by, and the passing
line = 2600 | 1 | gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and
line = 2601 | 1 | passing--like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life; how sweet it was
line = 2602 | 1 | to breathe the fresh air, that had no taint of death and decay; how
line = 2603 | 1 | humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill, and to
line = 2604 | 1 | hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city. Each
line = 2605 | 1 | in his own way was solemn and overcome. Arthur was silent, and was, I
line = 2606 | 1 | could see, striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the
line = 2607 | 1 | mystery. I was myself tolerably patient, and half inclined again to
line = 2608 | 1 | throw aside doubt and to accept Van Helsing's conclusions. Quincey
line = 2609 | 1 | Morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things, and
line = 2610 | 1 | accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery, with hazard of all he has to
line = 2611 | 1 | stake. Not being able to smoke, he cut himself a good-sized plug of
line = 2612 | 1 | tobacco and began to chew. As to Van Helsing, he was employed in a
line = 2613 | 1 | definite way. First he took from his bag a mass of what looked like
line = 2614 | 1 | thin, wafer-like biscuit, which was carefully rolled up in a white
line = 2615 | 1 | napkin; next he took out a double-handful of some whitish stuff, like
line = 2616 | 1 | dough or putty. He crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the
line = 2617 | 1 | mass between his hands. This he then took, and rolling it into thin
line = 2618 | 1 | strips, began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its
line = 2619 | 1 | setting in the tomb. I was somewhat puzzled at this, and being close,
line = 2620 | 1 | asked him what it was that he was doing. Arthur and Quincey drew near
line = 2621 | 1 | also, as they too were curious. He answered:--
line = 2622 | 1 | 
line = 2623 | 1 | "I am closing the tomb, so that the Un-Dead may not enter."
line = 2624 | 1 | 
line = 2625 | 1 | "And is that stuff you have put there going to do it?" asked Quincey.
line = 2626 | 1 | "Great Scott! Is this a game?"
line = 2627 | 1 | 
line = 2628 | 1 | "It is."
line = 2629 | 1 | 
line = 2630 | 1 | "What is that which you are using?" This time the question was by
line = 2631 | 1 | Arthur. Van Helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered:--
line = 2632 | 1 | 
line = 2633 | 1 | "The Host. I brought it from Amsterdam. I have an Indulgence." It was an
line = 2634 | 1 | answer that appalled the most sceptical of us, and we felt individually
line = 2635 | 1 | that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the Professor's, a
line = 2636 | 1 | purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things, it was
line = 2637 | 1 | impossible to distrust. In respectful silence we took the places
line = 2638 | 1 | assigned to us close round the tomb, but hidden from the sight of any
line = 2639 | 1 | one approaching. I pitied the others, especially Arthur. I had myself
line = 2640 | 1 | been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror; and yet I,
line = 2641 | 1 | who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs, felt my heart sink
line = 2642 | 1 | within me. Never did tombs look so ghastly white; never did cypress, or
line = 2643 | 1 | yew, or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom; never did tree
line = 2644 | 1 | or grass wave or rustle so ominously; never did bough creak so
line = 2645 | 1 | mysteriously; and never did the far-away howling of dogs send such a
line = 2646 | 1 | woeful presage through the night.
line = 2647 | 1 | 
line = 2648 | 1 | There was a long spell of silence, a big, aching void, and then from the
line = 2649 | 1 | Professor a keen "S-s-s-s!" He pointed; and far down the avenue of yews
line = 2650 | 1 | we saw a white figure advance--a dim white figure, which held something
line = 2651 | 1 | dark at its breast. The figure stopped, and at the moment a ray of
line = 2652 | 1 | moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling
line = 2653 | 1 | prominence a dark-haired woman, dressed in the cerements of the grave.
line = 2654 | 1 | We could not see the face, for it was bent down over what we saw to be a
line = 2655 | 1 | fair-haired child. There was a pause and a sharp little cry, such as a
line = 2656 | 1 | child gives in sleep, or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams. We
line = 2657 | 1 | were starting forward, but the Professor's warning hand, seen by us as
line = 2658 | 1 | he stood behind a yew-tree, kept us back; and then as we looked the
line = 2659 | 1 | white figure moved forwards again. It was now near enough for us to see
line = 2660 | 1 | clearly, and the moonlight still held. My own heart grew cold as ice,
line = 2661 | 1 | and I could hear the gasp of Arthur, as we recognised the features of
line = 2662 | 1 | Lucy Westenra. Lucy Westenra, but yet how changed. The sweetness was
line = 2663 | 1 | turned to adamantine, heartless cruelty, and the purity to voluptuous
line = 2664 | 1 | wantonness. Van Helsing stepped out, and, obedient to his gesture, we
line = 2665 | 1 | all advanced too; the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the
line = 2666 | 1 | tomb. Van Helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide; by the
line = 2667 | 1 | concentrated light that fell on Lucy's face we could see that the lips
line = 2668 | 1 | were crimson with fresh blood, and that the stream had trickled over her
line = 2669 | 1 | chin and stained the purity of her lawn death-robe.
line = 2670 | 1 | 
line = 2671 | 1 | We shuddered with horror. I could see by the tremulous light that even
line = 2672 | 1 | Van Helsing's iron nerve had failed. Arthur was next to me, and if I had
line = 2673 | 1 | not seized his arm and held him up, he would have fallen.
line = 2674 | 1 | 
line = 2675 | 1 | When Lucy--I call the thing that was before us Lucy because it bore her
line = 2676 | 1 | shape--saw us she drew back with an angry snarl, such as a cat gives
line = 2677 | 1 | when taken unawares; then her eyes ranged over us. Lucy's eyes in form
line = 2678 | 1 | and colour; but Lucy's eyes unclean and full of hell-fire, instead of
line = 2679 | 1 | the pure, gentle orbs we knew. At that moment the remnant of my love
line = 2680 | 1 | passed into hate and loathing; had she then to be killed, I could have
line = 2681 | 1 | done it with savage delight. As she looked, her eyes blazed with unholy
line = 2682 | 1 | light, and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile. Oh, God,
line = 2683 | 1 | how it made me shudder to see it! With a careless motion, she flung to
line = 2684 | 1 | the ground, callous as a devil, the child that up to now she had
line = 2685 | 1 | clutched strenuously to her breast, growling over it as a dog growls
line = 2686 | 1 | over a bone. The child gave a sharp cry, and lay there moaning. There
line = 2687 | 1 | was a cold-bloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from Arthur; when
line = 2688 | 1 | she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell
line = 2689 | 1 | back and hid his face in his hands.
line = 2690 | 1 | 
line = 2691 | 1 | She still advanced, however, and with a languorous, voluptuous grace,
line = 2692 | 1 | said:--
line = 2693 | 1 | 
line = 2694 | 1 | "Come to me, Arthur. Leave these others and come to me. My arms are
line = 2695 | 1 | hungry for you. Come, and we can rest together. Come, my husband, come!"
line = 2696 | 1 | 
line = 2697 | 1 | There was something diabolically sweet in her tones--something of the
line = 2698 | 1 | tingling of glass when struck--which rang through the brains even of us
line = 2699 | 1 | who heard the words addressed to another. As for Arthur, he seemed under
line = 2700 | 1 | a spell; moving his hands from his face, he opened wide his arms. She
line = 2701 | 1 | was leaping for them, when Van Helsing sprang forward and held between
line = 2702 | 1 | them his little golden crucifix. She recoiled from it, and, with a
line = 2703 | 1 | suddenly distorted face, full of rage, dashed past him as if to enter
line = 2704 | 1 | the tomb.
line = 2705 | 1 | 
line = 2706 | 1 | When within a foot or two of the door, however, she stopped, as if
line = 2707 | 1 | arrested by some irresistible force. Then she turned, and her face was
line = 2708 | 1 | shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp, which had now no
line = 2709 | 1 | quiver from Van Helsing's iron nerves. Never did I see such baffled
line = 2710 | 1 | malice on a face; and never, I trust, shall such ever be seen again by
line = 2711 | 1 | mortal eyes. The beautiful colour became livid, the eyes seemed to throw
line = 2712 | 1 | out sparks of hell-fire, the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of
line = 2713 | 1 | the flesh were the coils of Medusa's snakes, and the lovely,
line = 2714 | 1 | blood-stained mouth grew to an open square, as in the passion masks of
line = 2715 | 1 | the Greeks and Japanese. If ever a face meant death--if looks could
line = 2716 | 1 | kill--we saw it at that moment.
line = 2717 | 1 | 
line = 2718 | 1 | And so for full half a minute, which seemed an eternity, she remained
line = 2719 | 1 | between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of
line = 2720 | 1 | entry. Van Helsing broke the silence by asking Arthur:--
line = 2721 | 1 | 
line = 2722 | 1 | "Answer me, oh my friend! Am I to proceed in my work?"
line = 2723 | 1 | 
line = 2724 | 1 | Arthur threw himself on his knees, and hid his face in his hands, as he
line = 2725 | 1 | answered:--
line = 2726 | 1 | 
line = 2727 | 1 | "Do as you will, friend; do as you will. There can be no horror like
line = 2728 | 1 | this ever any more;" and he groaned in spirit. Quincey and I
line = 2729 | 1 | simultaneously moved towards him, and took his arms. We could hear the
line = 2730 | 1 | click of the closing lantern as Van Helsing held it down; coming close
line = 2731 | 1 | to the tomb, he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred
line = 2732 | 1 | emblem which he had placed there. We all looked on in horrified
line = 2733 | 1 | amazement as we saw, when he stood back, the woman, with a corporeal
line = 2734 | 1 | body as real at that moment as our own, pass in through the interstice
line = 2735 | 1 | where scarce a knife-blade could have gone. We all felt a glad sense of
line = 2736 | 1 | relief when we saw the Professor calmly restoring the strings of putty
line = 2737 | 1 | to the edges of the door.
line = 2738 | 1 | 
line = 2739 | 1 | When this was done, he lifted the child and said:
line = 2740 | 1 | 
line = 2741 | 1 | "Come now, my friends; we can do no more till to-morrow. There is a
line = 2742 | 1 | funeral at noon, so here we shall all come before long after that. The
line = 2743 | 1 | friends of the dead will all be gone by two, and when the sexton lock
line = 2744 | 1 | the gate we shall remain. Then there is more to do; but not like this of
line = 2745 | 1 | to-night. As for this little one, he is not much harm, and by to-morrow
line = 2746 | 1 | night he shall be well. We shall leave him where the police will find
line = 2747 | 1 | him, as on the other night; and then to home." Coming close to Arthur,
line = 2748 | 1 | he said:--
line = 2749 | 1 | 
line = 2750 | 1 | "My friend Arthur, you have had a sore trial; but after, when you look
line = 2751 | 1 | back, you will see how it was necessary. You are now in the bitter
line = 2752 | 1 | waters, my child. By this time to-morrow you will, please God, have
line = 2753 | 1 | passed them, and have drunk of the sweet waters; so do not mourn
line = 2754 | 1 | overmuch. Till then I shall not ask you to forgive me."
line = 2755 | 1 | 
line = 2756 | 1 | Arthur and Quincey came home with me, and we tried to cheer each other
line = 2757 | 1 | on the way. We had left the child in safety, and were tired; so we all
line = 2758 | 1 | slept with more or less reality of sleep.
line = 2759 | 1 | 
line = 2760 | 1 |        *       *       *       *       *
line = 2761 | 1 | 
line = 2762 | 1 | _29 September, night._--A little before twelve o'clock we three--Arthur,
line = 2763 | 1 | Quincey Morris, and myself--called for the Professor. It was odd to
line = 2764 | 1 | notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes. Of
line = 2765 | 1 | course, Arthur wore black, for he was in deep mourning, but the rest of
line = 2766 | 1 | us wore it by instinct. We got to the churchyard by half-past one, and
line = 2767 | 1 | strolled about, keeping out of official observation, so that when the
line = 2768 | 1 | gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief
line = 2769 | 1 | that every one had gone, had locked the gate, we had the place all to
line = 2770 | 1 | ourselves. Van Helsing, instead of his little black bag, had with him a
line = 2771 | 1 | long leather one, something like a cricketing bag; it was manifestly of
line = 2772 | 1 | fair weight.
line = 2773 | 1 | 
line = 2774 | 1 | When we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up
line = 2775 | 1 | the road, we silently, and as if by ordered intention, followed the
line = 2776 | 1 | Professor to the tomb. He unlocked the door, and we entered, closing it
line = 2777 | 1 | behind us. Then he took from his bag the lantern, which he lit, and also
line = 2778 | 1 | two wax candles, which, when lighted, he stuck, by melting their own
line = 2779 | 1 | ends, on other coffins, so that they might give light sufficient to work
line = 2780 | 1 | by. When he again lifted the lid off Lucy's coffin we all looked--Arthur
line = 2781 | 1 | trembling like an aspen--and saw that the body lay there in all its
line = 2782 | 1 | death-beauty. But there was no love in my own heart, nothing but
line = 2783 | 1 | loathing for the foul Thing which had taken Lucy's shape without her
line = 2784 | 1 | soul. I could see even Arthur's face grow hard as he looked. Presently
line = 2785 | 1 | he said to Van Helsing:--
line = 2786 | 1 | 
line = 2787 | 1 | "Is this really Lucy's body, or only a demon in her shape?"
line = 2788 | 1 | 
line = 2789 | 1 | "It is her body, and yet not it. But wait a while, and you all see her
line = 2790 | 1 | as she was, and is."
line = 2791 | 1 | 
line = 2792 | 1 | She seemed like a nightmare of Lucy as she lay there; the pointed teeth,
line = 2793 | 1 | the bloodstained, voluptuous mouth--which it made one shudder to
line = 2794 | 1 | see--the whole carnal and unspiritual appearance, seeming like a
line = 2795 | 1 | devilish mockery of Lucy's sweet purity. Van Helsing, with his usual
line = 2796 | 1 | methodicalness, began taking the various contents from his bag and
line = 2797 | 1 | placing them ready for use. First he took out a soldering iron and some
line = 2798 | 1 | plumbing solder, and then a small oil-lamp, which gave out, when lit in
line = 2799 | 1 | a corner of the tomb, gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue
line = 2800 | 1 | flame; then his operating knives, which he placed to hand; and last a
line = 2801 | 1 | round wooden stake, some two and a half or three inches thick and about
line = 2802 | 1 | three feet long. One end of it was hardened by charring in the fire, and
line = 2803 | 1 | was sharpened to a fine point. With this stake came a heavy hammer, such
line = 2804 | 1 | as in households is used in the coal-cellar for breaking the lumps. To
line = 2805 | 1 | me, a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and
line = 2806 | 1 | bracing, but the effect of these things on both Arthur and Quincey was
line = 2807 | 1 | to cause them a sort of consternation. They both, however, kept their
line = 2808 | 1 | courage, and remained silent and quiet.
line = 2809 | 1 | 
line = 2810 | 1 | When all was ready, Van Helsing said:--
line = 2811 | 1 | 
line = 2812 | 1 | "Before we do anything, let me tell you this; it is out of the lore and
line = 2813 | 1 | experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers
line = 2814 | 1 | of the Un-Dead. When they become such, there comes with the change the
line = 2815 | 1 | curse of immortality; they cannot die, but must go on age after age
line = 2816 | 1 | adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world; for all that
line = 2817 | 1 | die from the preying of the Un-Dead becomes themselves Un-Dead, and prey
line = 2818 | 1 | on their kind. And so the circle goes on ever widening, like as the
line = 2819 | 1 | ripples from a stone thrown in the water. Friend Arthur, if you had met
line = 2820 | 1 | that kiss which you know of before poor Lucy die; or again, last night
line = 2821 | 1 | when you open your arms to her, you would in time, when you had died,
line = 2822 | 1 | have become _nosferatu_, as they call it in Eastern Europe, and would
line = 2823 | 1 | all time make more of those Un-Deads that so have fill us with horror.
line = 2824 | 1 | The career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun. Those
line = 2825 | 1 | children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse; but if
line = 2826 | 1 | she live on, Un-Dead, more and more they lose their blood and by her
line = 2827 | 1 | power over them they come to her; and so she draw their blood with that
line = 2828 | 1 | so wicked mouth. But if she die in truth, then all cease; the tiny
line = 2829 | 1 | wounds of the throats disappear, and they go back to their plays
line = 2830 | 1 | unknowing ever of what has been. But of the most blessed of all, when
line = 2831 | 1 | this now Un-Dead be made to rest as true dead, then the soul of the poor
line = 2832 | 1 | lady whom we love shall again be free. Instead of working wickedness by
line = 2833 | 1 | night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day, she
line = 2834 | 1 | shall take her place with the other Angels. So that, my friend, it will
line = 2835 | 1 | be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free.
line = 2836 | 1 | To this I am willing; but is there none amongst us who has a better
line = 2837 | 1 | right? Will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the
line = 2838 | 1 | night when sleep is not: 'It was my hand that sent her to the stars; it
line = 2839 | 1 | was the hand of him that loved her best; the hand that of all she would
line = 2840 | 1 | herself have chosen, had it been to her to choose?' Tell me if there be
line = 2841 | 1 | such a one amongst us?"
line = 2842 | 1 | 
line = 2843 | 1 | We all looked at Arthur. He saw, too, what we all did, the infinite
line = 2844 | 1 | kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore
line = 2845 | 1 | Lucy to us as a holy, and not an unholy, memory; he stepped forward and
line = 2846 | 1 | said bravely, though his hand trembled, and his face was as pale as
line = 2847 | 1 | snow:--
line = 2848 | 1 | 
line = 2849 | 1 | "My true friend, from the bottom of my broken heart I thank you. Tell me
line = 2850 | 1 | what I am to do, and I shall not falter!" Van Helsing laid a hand on his
line = 2851 | 1 | shoulder, and said:--
line = 2852 | 1 | 
line = 2853 | 1 | "Brave lad! A moment's courage, and it is done. This stake must be
line = 2854 | 1 | driven through her. It will be a fearful ordeal--be not deceived in
line = 2855 | 1 | that--but it will be only a short time, and you will then rejoice more
line = 2856 | 1 | than your pain was great; from this grim tomb you will emerge as though
line = 2857 | 1 | you tread on air. But you must not falter when once you have begun. Only
line = 2858 | 1 | think that we, your true friends, are round you, and that we pray for
line = 2859 | 1 | you all the time."
line = 2860 | 1 | 
line = 2861 | 1 | "Go on," said Arthur hoarsely. "Tell me what I am to do."
line = 2862 | 1 | 
line = 2863 | 1 | "Take this stake in your left hand, ready to place the point over the
line = 2864 | 1 | heart, and the hammer in your right. Then when we begin our prayer for
line = 2865 | 1 | the dead--I shall read him, I have here the book, and the others shall
line = 2866 | 1 | follow--strike in God's name, that so all may be well with the dead that
line = 2867 | 1 | we love and that the Un-Dead pass away."
line = 2868 | 1 | 
line = 2869 | 1 | Arthur took the stake and the hammer, and when once his mind was set on
line = 2870 | 1 | action his hands never trembled nor even quivered. Van Helsing opened
line = 2871 | 1 | his missal and began to read, and Quincey and I followed as well as we
line = 2872 | 1 | could. Arthur placed the point over the heart, and as I looked I could
line = 2873 | 1 | see its dint in the white flesh. Then he struck with all his might.
line = 2874 | 1 | 
line = 2875 | 1 | The Thing in the coffin writhed; and a hideous, blood-curdling screech
line = 2876 | 1 | came from the opened red lips. The body shook and quivered and twisted
line = 2877 | 1 | in wild contortions; the sharp white teeth champed together till the
line = 2878 | 1 | lips were cut, and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam. But Arthur
line = 2879 | 1 | never faltered. He looked like a figure of Thor as his untrembling arm
line = 2880 | 1 | rose and fell, driving deeper and deeper the mercy-bearing stake, whilst
line = 2881 | 1 | the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it. His
line = 2882 | 1 | face was set, and high duty seemed to shine through it; the sight of it
line = 2883 | 1 | gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little
line = 2884 | 1 | vault.
line = 2885 | 1 | 
line = 2886 | 1 | And then the writhing and quivering of the body became less, and the
line = 2887 | 1 | teeth seemed to champ, and the face to quiver. Finally it lay still. The
line = 2888 | 1 | terrible task was over.
line = 2889 | 1 | 
line = 2890 | 1 | The hammer fell from Arthur's hand. He reeled and would have fallen had
line = 2891 | 1 | we not caught him. The great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead,
line = 2892 | 1 | and his breath came in broken gasps. It had indeed been an awful strain
line = 2893 | 1 | on him; and had he not been forced to his task by more than human
line = 2894 | 1 | considerations he could never have gone through with it. For a few
line = 2895 | 1 | minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the
line = 2896 | 1 | coffin. When we did, however, a murmur of startled surprise ran from one
line = 2897 | 1 | to the other of us. We gazed so eagerly that Arthur rose, for he had
line = 2898 | 1 | been seated on the ground, and came and looked too; and then a glad,
line = 2899 | 1 | strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of
line = 2900 | 1 | horror that lay upon it.
line = 2901 | 1 | 
line = 2902 | 1 | There, in the coffin lay no longer the foul Thing that we had so dreaded
line = 2903 | 1 | and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a
line = 2904 | 1 | privilege to the one best entitled to it, but Lucy as we had seen her in
line = 2905 | 1 | her life, with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity. True that
line = 2906 | 1 | there were there, as we had seen them in life, the traces of care and
line = 2907 | 1 | pain and waste; but these were all dear to us, for they marked her truth
line = 2908 | 1 | to what we knew. One and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like
line = 2909 | 1 | sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and
line = 2910 | 1 | symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever.
line = 2911 | 1 | 
line = 2912 | 1 | Van Helsing came and laid his hand on Arthur's shoulder, and said to
line = 2913 | 1 | him:--
line = 2914 | 1 | 
line = 2915 | 1 | "And now, Arthur my friend, dear lad, am I not forgiven?"
line = 2916 | 1 | 
line = 2917 | 1 | The reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man's hand
line = 2918 | 1 | in his, and raising it to his lips, pressed it, and said:--
line = 2919 | 1 | 
line = 2920 | 1 | "Forgiven! God bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again,
line = 2921 | 1 | and me peace." He put his hands on the Professor's shoulder, and laying
line = 2922 | 1 | his head on his breast, cried for a while silently, whilst we stood
line = 2923 | 1 | unmoving. When he raised his head Van Helsing said to him:--
line = 2924 | 1 | 
line = 2925 | 1 | "And now, my child, you may kiss her. Kiss her dead lips if you will, as
line = 2926 | 1 | she would have you to, if for her to choose. For she is not a grinning
line = 2927 | 1 | devil now--not any more a foul Thing for all eternity. No longer she is
line = 2928 | 1 | the devil's Un-Dead. She is God's true dead, whose soul is with Him!"
line = 2929 | 1 | 
line = 2930 | 1 | Arthur bent and kissed her, and then we sent him and Quincey out of the
line = 2931 | 1 | tomb; the Professor and I sawed the top off the stake, leaving the point
line = 2932 | 1 | of it in the body. Then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with
line = 2933 | 1 | garlic. We soldered up the leaden coffin, screwed on the coffin-lid,
line = 2934 | 1 | and gathering up our belongings, came away. When the Professor locked
line = 2935 | 1 | the door he gave the key to Arthur.
line = 2936 | 1 | 
line = 2937 | 1 | Outside the air was sweet, the sun shone, and the birds sang, and it
line = 2938 | 1 | seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch. There was
line = 2939 | 1 | gladness and mirth and peace everywhere, for we were at rest ourselves
line = 2940 | 1 | on one account, and we were glad, though it was with a tempered joy.
line = 2941 | 1 | 
line = 2942 | 1 | Before we moved away Van Helsing said:--
line = 2943 | 1 | 
line = 2944 | 1 | "Now, my friends, one step of our work is done, one the most harrowing
line = 2945 | 1 | to ourselves. But there remains a greater task: to find out the author
line = 2946 | 1 | of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out. I have clues which we can
line = 2947 | 1 | follow; but it is a long task, and a difficult, and there is danger in
line = 2948 | 1 | it, and pain. Shall you not all help me? We have learned to believe, all
line = 2949 | 1 | of us--is it not so? And since so, do we not see our duty? Yes! And do
line = 2950 | 1 | we not promise to go on to the bitter end?"
line = 2951 | 1 | 
line = 2952 | 1 | Each in turn, we took his hand, and the promise was made. Then said the
line = 2953 | 1 | Professor as we moved off:--
line = 2954 | 1 | 
line = 2955 | 1 | "Two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of
line = 2956 | 1 | the clock with friend John. I shall entreat two others, two that you
line = 2957 | 1 | know not as yet; and I shall be ready to all our work show and our plans
line = 2958 | 1 | unfold. Friend John, you come with me home, for I have much to consult
line = 2959 | 1 | about, and you can help me. To-night I leave for Amsterdam, but shall
line = 2960 | 1 | return to-morrow night. And then begins our great quest. But first I
line = 2961 | 1 | shall have much to say, so that you may know what is to do and to dread.
line = 2962 | 1 | Then our promise shall be made to each other anew; for there is a
line = 2963 | 1 | terrible task before us, and once our feet are on the ploughshare we
line = 2964 | 1 | must not draw back."
line = 2965 | 1 |

line = 2971 | 1 | DR. SEWARD'S DIARY--_continued_
line = 2972 | 1 | 
line = 2973 | 1 | 
line = 2974 | 1 | When we arrived at the Berkeley Hotel, Van Helsing found a telegram
line = 2975 | 1 | waiting for him:--
line = 2976 | 1 | 
line = 2977 | 1 |      "Am coming up by train. Jonathan at Whitby. Important news.--MINA
line = 2978 | 1 |      HARKER."
line = 2979 | 1 | 
line = 2980 | 1 | The Professor was delighted. "Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina," he said,
line = 2981 | 1 | "pearl among women! She arrive, but I cannot stay. She must go to your
line = 2982 | 1 | house, friend John. You must meet her at the station. Telegraph her _en
line = 2983 | 1 | route_, so that she may be prepared."
line = 2984 | 1 | 
line = 2985 | 1 | When the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea; over it he told me of
line = 2986 | 1 | a diary kept by Jonathan Harker when abroad, and gave me a typewritten
line = 2987 | 1 | copy of it, as also of Mrs. Harker's diary at Whitby. "Take these," he
line = 2988 | 1 | said, "and study them well. When I have returned you will be master of
line = 2989 | 1 | all the facts, and we can then better enter on our inquisition. Keep
line = 2990 | 1 | them safe, for there is in them much of treasure. You will need all your
line = 2991 | 1 | faith, even you who have had such an experience as that of to-day. What
line = 2992 | 1 | is here told," he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of
line = 2993 | 1 | papers as he spoke, "may be the beginning of the end to you and me and
line = 2994 | 1 | many another; or it may sound the knell of the Un-Dead who walk the
line = 2995 | 1 | earth. Read all, I pray you, with the open mind; and if you can add in
line = 2996 | 1 | any way to the story here told do so, for it is all-important. You have
line = 2997 | 1 | kept diary of all these so strange things; is it not so? Yes! Then we
line = 2998 | 1 | shall go through all these together when we meet." He then made ready
line = 2999 | 1 | for his departure, and shortly after drove off to Liverpool Street. I
line = 3000 | 1 | took my way to Paddington, where I arrived about fifteen minutes before
line = 3001 | 1 | the train came in.
line = 3002 | 1 | 
line = 3003 | 1 | The crowd melted away, after the bustling fashion common to arrival
line = 3004 | 1 | platforms; and I was beginning to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my
line = 3005 | 1 | guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty-looking girl stepped up to me, and,
line = 3006 | 1 | after a quick glance, said: "Dr. Seward, is it not?"
line = 3007 | 1 | 
line = 3008 | 1 | "And you are Mrs. Harker!" I answered at once; whereupon she held out
line = 3009 | 1 | her hand.
line = 3010 | 1 | 
line = 3011 | 1 | "I knew you from the description of poor dear Lucy; but----" She stopped
line = 3012 | 1 | suddenly, and a quick blush overspread her face.
line = 3013 | 1 | 
line = 3014 | 1 | The blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease, for it
line = 3015 | 1 | was a tacit answer to her own. I got her luggage, which included a
line = 3016 | 1 | typewriter, and we took the Underground to Fenchurch Street, after I had
line = 3017 | 1 | sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sitting-room and bedroom
line = 3018 | 1 | prepared at once for Mrs. Harker.
line = 3019 | 1 | 
line = 3020 | 1 | In due time we arrived. She knew, of course, that the place was a
line = 3021 | 1 | lunatic asylum, but I could see that she was unable to repress a shudder
line = 3022 | 1 | when we entered.
line = 3023 | 1 | 
line = 3024 | 1 | She told me that, if she might, she would come presently to my study, as
line = 3025 | 1 | she had much to say. So here I am finishing my entry in my phonograph
line = 3026 | 1 | diary whilst I await her. As yet I have not had the chance of looking at
line = 3027 | 1 | the papers which Van Helsing left with me, though they lie open before
line = 3028 | 1 | me. I must get her interested in something, so that I may have an
line = 3029 | 1 | opportunity of reading them. She does not know how precious time is, or
line = 3030 | 1 | what a task we have in hand. I must be careful not to frighten her. Here
line = 3031 | 1 | she is!
line = 3032 | 1 | 
line = 3033 | 1 | 
line = 3034 | 1 | _Mina Harker's Journal._
line = 3035 | 1 | 
line = 3036 | 1 | _29 September._--After I had tidied myself, I went down to Dr. Seward's
line = 3037 | 1 | study. At the door I paused a moment, for I thought I heard him talking
line = 3038 | 1 | with some one. As, however, he had pressed me to be quick, I knocked at
line = 3039 | 1 | the door, and on his calling out, "Come in," I entered.
line = 3040 | 1 | 
line = 3041 | 1 | To my intense surprise, there was no one with him. He was quite alone,
line = 3042 | 1 | and on the table opposite him was what I knew at once from the
line = 3043 | 1 | description to be a phonograph. I had never seen one, and was much
line = 3044 | 1 | interested.
line = 3045 | 1 | 
line = 3046 | 1 | "I hope I did not keep you waiting," I said; "but I stayed at the door
line = 3047 | 1 | as I heard you talking, and thought there was some one with you."
line = 3048 | 1 | 
line = 3049 | 1 | "Oh," he replied with a smile, "I was only entering my diary."
line = 3050 | 1 | 
line = 3051 | 1 | "Your diary?" I asked him in surprise.
line = 3052 | 1 | 
line = 3053 | 1 | "Yes," he answered. "I keep it in this." As he spoke he laid his hand on
line = 3054 | 1 | the phonograph. I felt quite excited over it, and blurted out:--
line = 3055 | 1 | 
line = 3056 | 1 | "Why, this beats even shorthand! May I hear it say something?"
line = 3057 | 1 | 
line = 3058 | 1 | "Certainly," he replied with alacrity, and stood up to put it in train
line = 3059 | 1 | for speaking. Then he paused, and a troubled look overspread his face.
line = 3060 | 1 | 
line = 3061 | 1 | "The fact is," he began awkwardly, "I only keep my diary in it; and as
line = 3062 | 1 | it is entirely--almost entirely--about my cases, it may be awkward--that
line = 3063 | 1 | is, I mean----" He stopped, and I tried to help him out of his
line = 3064 | 1 | embarrassment:--
line = 3065 | 1 | 
line = 3066 | 1 | "You helped to attend dear Lucy at the end. Let me hear how she died;
line = 3067 | 1 | for all that I know of her, I shall be very grateful. She was very, very
line = 3068 | 1 | dear to me."
line = 3069 | 1 | 
line = 3070 | 1 | To my surprise, he answered, with a horrorstruck look in his face:--
line = 3071 | 1 | 
line = 3072 | 1 | "Tell you of her death? Not for the wide world!"
line = 3073 | 1 | 
line = 3074 | 1 | "Why not?" I asked, for some grave, terrible feeling was coming over me.
line = 3075 | 1 | Again he paused, and I could see that he was trying to invent an excuse.
line = 3076 | 1 | At length he stammered out:--
line = 3077 | 1 | 
line = 3078 | 1 | "You see, I do not know how to pick out any particular part of the
line = 3079 | 1 | diary." Even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him, and he said
line = 3080 | 1 | with unconscious simplicity, in a different voice, and with the naïveté
line = 3081 | 1 | of a child: "That's quite true, upon my honour. Honest Indian!" I could
line = 3082 | 1 | not but smile, at which he grimaced. "I gave myself away that time!" he
line = 3083 | 1 | said. "But do you know that, although I have kept the diary for months
line = 3084 | 1 | past, it never once struck me how I was going to find any particular
line = 3085 | 1 | part of it in case I wanted to look it up?" By this time my mind was
line = 3086 | 1 | made up that the diary of a doctor who attended Lucy might have
line = 3087 | 1 | something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible Being, and
line = 3088 | 1 | I said boldly:--
line = 3089 | 1 | 
line = 3090 | 1 | "Then, Dr. Seward, you had better let me copy it out for you on my
line = 3091 | 1 | typewriter." He grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said:--
line = 3092 | 1 | 
line = 3093 | 1 | "No! no! no! For all the world, I wouldn't let you know that terrible
line = 3094 | 1 | story!"
line = 3095 | 1 | 
line = 3096 | 1 | Then it was terrible; my intuition was right! For a moment I thought,
line = 3097 | 1 | and as my eyes ranged the room, unconsciously looking for something or
line = 3098 | 1 | some opportunity to aid me, they lit on a great batch of typewriting on
line = 3099 | 1 | the table. His eyes caught the look in mine, and, without his thinking,
line = 3100 | 1 | followed their direction. As they saw the parcel he realised my meaning.
line = 3101 | 1 | 
line = 3102 | 1 | "You do not know me," I said. "When you have read those papers--my own
line = 3103 | 1 | diary and my husband's also, which I have typed--you will know me
line = 3104 | 1 | better. I have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in
line = 3105 | 1 | this cause; but, of course, you do not know me--yet; and I must not
line = 3106 | 1 | expect you to trust me so far."
line = 3107 | 1 | 
line = 3108 | 1 | He is certainly a man of noble nature; poor dear Lucy was right about
line = 3109 | 1 | him. He stood up and opened a large drawer, in which were arranged in
line = 3110 | 1 | order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax, and
line = 3111 | 1 | said:--
line = 3112 | 1 | 
line = 3113 | 1 | "You are quite right. I did not trust you because I did not know you.
line = 3114 | 1 | But I know you now; and let me say that I should have known you long
line = 3115 | 1 | ago. I know that Lucy told you of me; she told me of you too. May I make
line = 3116 | 1 | the only atonement in my power? Take the cylinders and hear them--the
line = 3117 | 1 | first half-dozen of them are personal to me, and they will not horrify
line = 3118 | 1 | you; then you will know me better. Dinner will by then be ready. In the
line = 3119 | 1 | meantime I shall read over some of these documents, and shall be better
line = 3120 | 1 | able to understand certain things." He carried the phonograph himself up
line = 3121 | 1 | to my sitting-room and adjusted it for me. Now I shall learn something
line = 3122 | 1 | pleasant, I am sure; for it will tell me the other side of a true love
line = 3123 | 1 | episode of which I know one side already....
line = 3124 | 1 | 
line = 3125 | 1 | 
line = 3126 | 1 | _Dr. Seward's Diary._
line = 3127 | 1 | 
line = 3128 | 1 | _29 September._--I was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of Jonathan
line = 3129 | 1 | Harker and that other of his wife that I let the time run on without
line = 3130 | 1 | thinking. Mrs. Harker was not down when the maid came to announce
line = 3131 | 1 | dinner, so I said: "She is possibly tired; let dinner wait an hour," and
line = 3132 | 1 | I went on with my work. I had just finished Mrs. Harker's diary, when
line = 3133 | 1 | she came in. She looked sweetly pretty, but very sad, and her eyes were
line = 3134 | 1 | flushed with crying. This somehow moved me much. Of late I have had
line = 3135 | 1 | cause for tears, God knows! but the relief of them was denied me; and
line = 3136 | 1 | now the sight of those sweet eyes, brightened with recent tears, went
line = 3137 | 1 | straight to my heart. So I said as gently as I could:--
line = 3138 | 1 | 
line = 3139 | 1 | "I greatly fear I have distressed you."
line = 3140 | 1 | 
line = 3141 | 1 | "Oh, no, not distressed me," she replied, "but I have been more touched
line = 3142 | 1 | than I can say by your grief. That is a wonderful machine, but it is
line = 3143 | 1 | cruelly true. It told me, in its very tones, the anguish of your heart.
line = 3144 | 1 | It was like a soul crying out to Almighty God. No one must hear them
line = 3145 | 1 | spoken ever again! See, I have tried to be useful. I have copied out the
line = 3146 | 1 | words on my typewriter, and none other need now hear your heart beat, as
line = 3147 | 1 | I did."
line = 3148 | 1 | 
line = 3149 | 1 | "No one need ever know, shall ever know," I said in a low voice. She
line = 3150 | 1 | laid her hand on mine and said very gravely:--
line = 3151 | 1 | 
line = 3152 | 1 | "Ah, but they must!"
line = 3153 | 1 | 
line = 3154 | 1 | "Must! But why?" I asked.
line = 3155 | 1 | 
line = 3156 | 1 | "Because it is a part of the terrible story, a part of poor dear Lucy's
line = 3157 | 1 | death and all that led to it; because in the struggle which we have
line = 3158 | 1 | before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all
line = 3159 | 1 | the knowledge and all the help which we can get. I think that the
line = 3160 | 1 | cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know;
line = 3161 | 1 | but I can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark
line = 3162 | 1 | mystery. You will let me help, will you not? I know all up to a certain
line = 3163 | 1 | point; and I see already, though your diary only took me to 7 September,
line = 3164 | 1 | how poor Lucy was beset, and how her terrible doom was being wrought
line = 3165 | 1 | out. Jonathan and I have been working day and night since Professor Van
line = 3166 | 1 | Helsing saw us. He is gone to Whitby to get more information, and he
line = 3167 | 1 | will be here to-morrow to help us. We need have no secrets amongst us;
line = 3168 | 1 | working together and with absolute trust, we can surely be stronger than
line = 3169 | 1 | if some of us were in the dark." She looked at me so appealingly, and at
line = 3170 | 1 | the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing,
line = 3171 | 1 | that I gave in at once to her wishes. "You shall," I said, "do as you
line = 3172 | 1 | like in the matter. God forgive me if I do wrong! There are terrible
line = 3173 | 1 | things yet to learn of; but if you have so far travelled on the road to
line = 3174 | 1 | poor Lucy's death, you will not be content, I know, to remain in the
line = 3175 | 1 | dark. Nay, the end--the very end--may give you a gleam of peace. Come,
line = 3176 | 1 | there is dinner. We must keep one another strong for what is before us;
line = 3177 | 1 | we have a cruel and dreadful task. When you have eaten you shall learn
line = 3178 | 1 | the rest, and I shall answer any questions you ask--if there be anything
line = 3179 | 1 | which you do not understand, though it was apparent to us who were
line = 3180 | 1 | present."

line = 3183 | 1 | _Mina Harker's Journal._
line = 3184 | 1 | 
line = 3185 | 1 | _29 September._--After dinner I came with Dr. Seward to his study. He
line = 3186 | 1 | brought back the phonograph from my room, and I took my typewriter. He
line = 3187 | 1 | placed me in a comfortable chair, and arranged the phonograph so that I
line = 3188 | 1 | could touch it without getting up, and showed me how to stop it in case
line = 3189 | 1 | I should want to pause. Then he very thoughtfully took a chair, with his
line = 3190 | 1 | back to me, so that I might be as free as possible, and began to read. I
line = 3191 | 1 | put the forked metal to my ears and listened.
line = 3192 | 1 | 
line = 3193 | 1 | When the terrible story of Lucy's death, and--and all that followed, was
line = 3194 | 1 | done, I lay back in my chair powerless. Fortunately I am not of a
line = 3195 | 1 | fainting disposition. When Dr. Seward saw me he jumped up with a
line = 3196 | 1 | horrified exclamation, and hurriedly taking a case-bottle from a
line = 3197 | 1 | cupboard, gave me some brandy, which in a few minutes somewhat restored
line = 3198 | 1 | me. My brain was all in a whirl, and only that there came through all
line = 3199 | 1 | the multitude of horrors, the holy ray of light that my dear, dear Lucy
line = 3200 | 1 | was at last at peace, I do not think I could have borne it without
line = 3201 | 1 | making a scene. It is all so wild, and mysterious, and strange that if I
line = 3202 | 1 | had not known Jonathan's experience in Transylvania I could not have
line = 3203 | 1 | believed. As it was, I didn't know what to believe, and so got out of my
line = 3204 | 1 | difficulty by attending to something else. I took the cover off my
line = 3205 | 1 | typewriter, and said to Dr. Seward:--
line = 3206 | 1 | 
line = 3207 | 1 | "Let me write this all out now. We must be ready for Dr. Van Helsing
line = 3208 | 1 | when he comes. I have sent a telegram to Jonathan to come on here when
line = 3209 | 1 | he arrives in London from Whitby. In this matter dates are everything,
line = 3210 | 1 | and I think that if we get all our material ready, and have every item
line = 3211 | 1 | put in chronological order, we shall have done much. You tell me that
line = 3212 | 1 | Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris are coming too. Let us be able to tell him
line = 3213 | 1 | when they come." He accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace, and I
line = 3214 | 1 | began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder. I used
line = 3215 | 1 | manifold, and so took three copies of the diary, just as I had done with
line = 3216 | 1 | all the rest. It was late when I got through, but Dr. Seward went about
line = 3217 | 1 | his work of going his round of the patients; when he had finished he
line = 3218 | 1 | came back and sat near me, reading, so that I did not feel too lonely
line = 3219 | 1 | whilst I worked. How good and thoughtful he is; the world seems full of
line = 3220 | 1 | good men--even if there _are_ monsters in it. Before I left him I
line = 3221 | 1 | remembered what Jonathan put in his diary of the Professor's
line = 3222 | 1 | perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at
line = 3223 | 1 | Exeter; so, seeing that Dr. Seward keeps his newspapers, I borrowed the
line = 3224 | 1 | files of "The Westminster Gazette" and "The Pall Mall Gazette," and took
line = 3225 | 1 | them to my room. I remember how much "The Dailygraph" and "The Whitby
line = 3226 | 1 | Gazette," of which I had made cuttings, helped us to understand the
line = 3227 | 1 | terrible events at Whitby when Count Dracula landed, so I shall look
line = 3228 | 1 | through the evening papers since then, and perhaps I shall get some new
line = 3229 | 1 | light. I am not sleepy, and the work will help to keep me quiet.

line = 3234 | 1 | _30 September._--Mr. Harker arrived at nine o'clock. He had got his
line = 3235 | 1 | wife's wire just before starting. He is uncommonly clever, if one can
line = 3236 | 1 | judge from his face, and full of energy. If this journal be true--and
line = 3237 | 1 | judging by one's own wonderful experiences, it must be--he is also a man
line = 3238 | 1 | of great nerve. That going down to the vault a second time was a
line = 3239 | 1 | remarkable piece of daring. After reading his account of it I was
line = 3240 | 1 | prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood, but hardly the quiet,
line = 3241 | 1 | business-like gentleman who came here to-day.
line = 3242 | 1 | 
line = 3243 | 1 |        *       *       *       *       *
line = 3244 | 1 | 
line = 3245 | 1 | _Later._--After lunch Harker and his wife went back to their own room,
line = 3246 | 1 | and as I passed a while ago I heard the click of the typewriter. They
line = 3247 | 1 | are hard at it. Mrs. Harker says that they are knitting together in
line = 3248 | 1 | chronological order every scrap of evidence they have. Harker has got
line = 3249 | 1 | the letters between the consignee of the boxes at Whitby and the
line = 3250 | 1 | carriers in London who took charge of them. He is now reading his wife's
line = 3251 | 1 | typescript of my diary. I wonder what they make out of it. Here it
line = 3252 | 1 | is....
line = 3253 | 1 | 
line = 3254 | 1 |      Strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be
line = 3255 | 1 |      the Count's hiding-place! Goodness knows that we had enough clues
line = 3256 | 1 |      from the conduct of the patient Renfield! The bundle of letters
line = 3257 | 1 |      relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript. Oh,
line = 3258 | 1 |      if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor Lucy!
line = 3259 | 1 |      Stop; that way madness lies! Harker has gone back, and is again
line = 3260 | 1 |      collating his material. He says that by dinner-time they will be
line = 3261 | 1 |      able to show a whole connected narrative. He thinks that in the
line = 3262 | 1 |      meantime I should see Renfield, as hitherto he has been a sort of
line = 3263 | 1 |      index to the coming and going of the Count. I hardly see this yet,
line = 3264 | 1 |      but when I get at the dates I suppose I shall. What a good thing
line = 3265 | 1 |      that Mrs. Harker put my cylinders into type! We never could have
line = 3266 | 1 |      found the dates otherwise....
line = 3267 | 1 | 
line = 3268 | 1 |      I found Renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands
line = 3269 | 1 |      folded, smiling benignly. At the moment he seemed as sane as any
line = 3270 | 1 |      one I ever saw. I sat down and talked with him on a lot of
line = 3271 | 1 |      subjects, all of which he treated naturally. He then, of his own
line = 3272 | 1 |      accord, spoke of going home, a subject he has never mentioned to my
line = 3273 | 1 |      knowledge during his sojourn here. In fact, he spoke quite
line = 3274 | 1 |      confidently of getting his discharge at once. I believe that, had I
line = 3275 | 1 |      not had the chat with Harker and read the letters and the dates of
line = 3276 | 1 |      his outbursts, I should have been prepared to sign for him after a
line = 3277 | 1 |      brief time of observation. As it is, I am darkly suspicious. All
line = 3278 | 1 |      those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the
line = 3279 | 1 |      Count. What then does this absolute content mean? Can it be that
line = 3280 | 1 |      his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph?
line = 3281 | 1 |      Stay; he is himself zoöphagous, and in his wild ravings outside the
line = 3282 | 1 |      chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of "master." This
line = 3283 | 1 |      all seems confirmation of our idea. However, after a while I came
line = 3284 | 1 |      away; my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it
line = 3285 | 1 |      safe to probe him too deep with questions. He might begin to think,
line = 3286 | 1 |      and then--! So I came away. I mistrust these quiet moods of his; so
line = 3287 | 1 |      I have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him, and to
line = 3288 | 1 |      have a strait-waistcoat ready in case of need.

line = 3292 | 1 | 
line = 3293 | 1 | _29 September, in train to London._--When I received Mr. Billington's
line = 3294 | 1 | courteous message that he would give me any information in his power I
line = 3295 | 1 | thought it best to go down to Whitby and make, on the spot, such
line = 3296 | 1 | inquiries as I wanted. It was now my object to trace that horrid cargo
line = 3297 | 1 | of the Count's to its place in London. Later, we may be able to deal
line = 3298 | 1 | with it. Billington junior, a nice lad, met me at the station, and
line = 3299 | 1 | brought me to his father's house, where they had decided that I must
line = 3300 | 1 | stay the night. They are hospitable, with true Yorkshire hospitality:
line = 3301 | 1 | give a guest everything, and leave him free to do as he likes. They all
line = 3302 | 1 | knew that I was busy, and that my stay was short, and Mr. Billington had
line = 3303 | 1 | ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes.
line = 3304 | 1 | It gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which I had
line = 3305 | 1 | seen on the Count's table before I knew of his diabolical plans.
line = 3306 | 1 | Everything had been carefully thought out, and done systematically and
line = 3307 | 1 | with precision. He seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which
line = 3308 | 1 | might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried
line = 3309 | 1 | out. To use an Americanism, he had "taken no chances," and the absolute
line = 3310 | 1 | accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled, was simply the
line = 3311 | 1 | logical result of his care. I saw the invoice, and took note of it:
line = 3312 | 1 | "Fifty cases of common earth, to be used for experimental purposes."
line = 3313 | 1 | Also the copy of letter to Carter Paterson, and their reply; of both of
line = 3314 | 1 | these I got copies. This was all the information Mr. Billington could
line = 3315 | 1 | give me, so I went down to the port and saw the coastguards, the Customs
line = 3316 | 1 | officers and the harbour-master. They had all something to say of the
line = 3317 | 1 | strange entry of the ship, which is already taking its place in local
line = 3318 | 1 | tradition; but no one could add to the simple description "Fifty cases
line = 3319 | 1 | of common earth." I then saw the station-master, who kindly put me in
line = 3320 | 1 | communication with the men who had actually received the boxes. Their
line = 3321 | 1 | tally was exact with the list, and they had nothing to add except that
line = 3322 | 1 | the boxes were "main and mortal heavy," and that shifting them was dry
line = 3323 | 1 | work. One of them added that it was hard lines that there wasn't any
line = 3324 | 1 | gentleman "such-like as yourself, squire," to show some sort of
line = 3325 | 1 | appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form; another put in a rider
line = 3326 | 1 | that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had
line = 3327 | 1 | elapsed had not completely allayed it. Needless to add, I took care
line = 3328 | 1 | before leaving to lift, for ever and adequately, this source of
line = 3329 | 1 | reproach.

line = 3333 | 1 | _30 September._--The station-master was good enough to give me a line to
line = 3334 | 1 | his old companion the station-master at King's Cross, so that when I
line = 3335 | 1 | arrived there in the morning I was able to ask him about the arrival of
line = 3336 | 1 | the boxes. He, too, put me at once in communication with the proper
line = 3337 | 1 | officials, and I saw that their tally was correct with the original
line = 3338 | 1 | invoice. The opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here
line = 3339 | 1 | limited; a noble use of them had, however, been made, and again I was
line = 3340 | 1 | compelled to deal with the result in an _ex post facto_ manner.
line = 3341 | 1 | 
line = 3342 | 1 | From thence I went on to Carter Paterson's central office, where I met
line = 3343 | 1 | with the utmost courtesy. They looked up the transaction in their
line = 3344 | 1 | day-book and letter-book, and at once telephoned to their King's Cross
line = 3345 | 1 | office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming
line = 3346 | 1 | were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending
line = 3347 | 1 | also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the
line = 3348 | 1 | delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing
line = 3349 | 1 | exactly; the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the
line = 3350 | 1 | written words with a few details. These were, I shortly found, connected
line = 3351 | 1 | almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and of the consequent
line = 3352 | 1 | thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity,
line = 3353 | 1 | through the medium of the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a
line = 3354 | 1 | later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked:--
line = 3355 | 1 | 
line = 3356 | 1 | "That 'ere 'ouse, guv'nor, is the rummiest I ever was in. Blyme! but it
line = 3357 | 1 | ain't been touched sence a hundred years. There was dust that thick in
line = 3358 | 1 | the place that you might have slep' on it without 'urtin' of yer bones;
line = 3359 | 1 | an' the place was that neglected that yer might 'ave smelled ole
line = 3360 | 1 | Jerusalem in it. But the ole chapel--that took the cike, that did! Me
line = 3361 | 1 | and my mate, we thort we wouldn't never git out quick enough. Lor', I
line = 3362 | 1 | wouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark."
line = 3363 | 1 | 
line = 3364 | 1 | Having been in the house, I could well believe him; but if he knew what
line = 3365 | 1 | I know, he would, I think, have raised his terms.
line = 3366 | 1 | 
line = 3367 | 1 | Of one thing I am now satisfied: that _all_ the boxes which arrived at
line = 3368 | 1 | Whitby from Varna in the _Demeter_ were safely deposited in the old
line = 3369 | 1 | chapel at Carfax. There should be fifty of them there, unless any have
line = 3370 | 1 | since been removed--as from Dr. Seward's diary I fear.
line = 3371 | 1 | 
line = 3372 | 1 | I shall try to see the carter who took away the boxes from Carfax when
line = 3373 | 1 | Renfield attacked them. By following up this clue we may learn a good

line = 3386 | 1 | that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act
line = 3387 | 1 | detrimentally on Jonathan. I saw him leave for Whitby with as brave a
line = 3388 | 1 | face as I could, but I was sick with apprehension. The effort has,
line = 3389 | 1 | however, done him good. He was never so resolute, never so strong, never
line = 3390 | 1 | so full of volcanic energy, as at present. It is just as that dear, good
line = 3391 | 1 | Professor Van Helsing said: he is true grit, and he improves under
line = 3392 | 1 | strain that would kill a weaker nature. He came back full of life and
line = 3393 | 1 | hope and determination; we have got everything in order for to-night. I
line = 3394 | 1 | feel myself quite wild with excitement. I suppose one ought to pity any
line = 3395 | 1 | thing so hunted as is the Count. That is just it: this Thing is not
line = 3396 | 1 | human--not even beast. To read Dr. Seward's account of poor Lucy's
line = 3397 | 1 | death, and what followed, is enough to dry up the springs of pity in
line = 3398 | 1 | one's heart.

line = 3402 | 1 | _Later._--Lord Godalming and Mr. Morris arrived earlier than we
line = 3403 | 1 | expected. Dr. Seward was out on business, and had taken Jonathan with
line = 3404 | 1 | him, so I had to see them. It was to me a painful meeting, for it
line = 3405 | 1 | brought back all poor dear Lucy's hopes of only a few months ago. Of
line = 3406 | 1 | course they had heard Lucy speak of me, and it seemed that Dr. Van
line = 3407 | 1 | Helsing, too, has been quite "blowing my trumpet," as Mr. Morris
line = 3408 | 1 | expressed it. Poor fellows, neither of them is aware that I know all
line = 3409 | 1 | about the proposals they made to Lucy. They did not quite know what to
line = 3410 | 1 | say or do, as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge; so they
line = 3411 | 1 | had to keep on neutral subjects. However, I thought the matter over, and
line = 3412 | 1 | came to the conclusion that the best thing I could do would be to post
line = 3413 | 1 | them in affairs right up to date. I knew from Dr. Seward's diary that
line = 3414 | 1 | they had been at Lucy's death--her real death--and that I need not fear
line = 3415 | 1 | to betray any secret before the time. So I told them, as well as I
line = 3416 | 1 | could, that I had read all the papers and diaries, and that my husband
line = 3417 | 1 | and I, having typewritten them, had just finished putting them in order.
line = 3418 | 1 | I gave them each a copy to read in the library. When Lord Godalming got
line = 3419 | 1 | his and turned it over--it does make a pretty good pile--he said:--
line = 3420 | 1 | 
line = 3421 | 1 | "Did you write all this, Mrs. Harker?"
line = 3422 | 1 | 
line = 3423 | 1 | I nodded, and he went on:--
line = 3424 | 1 | 
line = 3425 | 1 | "I don't quite see the drift of it; but you people are all so good and
line = 3426 | 1 | kind, and have been working so earnestly and so energetically, that all
line = 3427 | 1 | I can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you. I have
line = 3428 | 1 | had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble
line = 3429 | 1 | to the last hour of his life. Besides, I know you loved my poor Lucy--"
line = 3430 | 1 | Here he turned away and covered his face with his hands. I could hear
line = 3431 | 1 | the tears in his voice. Mr. Morris, with instinctive delicacy, just laid
line = 3432 | 1 | a hand for a moment on his shoulder, and then walked quietly out of the
line = 3433 | 1 | room. I suppose there is something in woman's nature that makes a man
line = 3434 | 1 | free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or
line = 3435 | 1 | emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood; for when
line = 3436 | 1 | Lord Godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and
line = 3437 | 1 | gave way utterly and openly. I sat down beside him and took his hand. I
line = 3438 | 1 | hope he didn't think it forward of me, and that if he ever thinks of it
line = 3439 | 1 | afterwards he never will have such a thought. There I wrong him; I
line = 3440 | 1 | _know_ he never will--he is too true a gentleman. I said to him, for I
line = 3441 | 1 | could see that his heart was breaking:--
line = 3442 | 1 | 
line = 3443 | 1 | "I loved dear Lucy, and I know what she was to you, and what you were to
line = 3444 | 1 | her. She and I were like sisters; and now she is gone, will you not let
line = 3445 | 1 | me be like a sister to you in your trouble? I know what sorrows you have
line = 3446 | 1 | had, though I cannot measure the depth of them. If sympathy and pity can
line = 3447 | 1 | help in your affliction, won't you let me be of some little service--for
line = 3448 | 1 | Lucy's sake?"
line = 3449 | 1 | 
line = 3450 | 1 | In an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief. It seemed
line = 3451 | 1 | to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a
line = 3452 | 1 | vent at once. He grew quite hysterical, and raising his open hands, beat
line = 3453 | 1 | his palms together in a perfect agony of grief. He stood up and then sat
line = 3454 | 1 | down again, and the tears rained down his cheeks. I felt an infinite
line = 3455 | 1 | pity for him, and opened my arms unthinkingly. With a sob he laid his
line = 3456 | 1 | head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child, whilst he shook with
line = 3457 | 1 | emotion.
line = 3458 | 1 | 
line = 3459 | 1 | We women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above
line = 3460 | 1 | smaller matters when the mother-spirit is invoked; I felt this big
line = 3461 | 1 | sorrowing man's head resting on me, as though it were that of the baby
line = 3462 | 1 | that some day may lie on my bosom, and I stroked his hair as though he
line = 3463 | 1 | were my own child. I never thought at the time how strange it all was.
line = 3464 | 1 | 
line = 3465 | 1 | After a little bit his sobs ceased, and he raised himself with an
line = 3466 | 1 | apology, though he made no disguise of his emotion. He told me that for
line = 3467 | 1 | days and nights past--weary days and sleepless nights--he had been
line = 3468 | 1 | unable to speak with any one, as a man must speak in his time of
line = 3469 | 1 | sorrow. There was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him, or with
line = 3470 | 1 | whom, owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was
line = 3471 | 1 | surrounded, he could speak freely. "I know now how I suffered," he said,
line = 3472 | 1 | as he dried his eyes, "but I do not know even yet--and none other can
line = 3473 | 1 | ever know--how much your sweet sympathy has been to me to-day. I shall
line = 3474 | 1 | know better in time; and believe me that, though I am not ungrateful
line = 3475 | 1 | now, my gratitude will grow with my understanding. You will let me be
line = 3476 | 1 | like a brother, will you not, for all our lives--for dear Lucy's sake?"
line = 3477 | 1 | 
line = 3478 | 1 | "For dear Lucy's sake," I said as we clasped hands. "Ay, and for your
line = 3479 | 1 | own sake," he added, "for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth
line = 3480 | 1 | the winning, you have won mine to-day. If ever the future should bring
line = 3481 | 1 | to you a time when you need a man's help, believe me, you will not call
line = 3482 | 1 | in vain. God grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the
line = 3483 | 1 | sunshine of your life; but if it should ever come, promise me that you
line = 3484 | 1 | will let me know." He was so earnest, and his sorrow was so fresh, that
line = 3485 | 1 | I felt it would comfort him, so I said:--
line = 3486 | 1 | 
line = 3487 | 1 | "I promise."
line = 3488 | 1 | 
line = 3489 | 1 | As I came along the corridor I saw Mr. Morris looking out of a window.
line = 3490 | 1 | He turned as he heard my footsteps. "How is Art?" he said. Then noticing
line = 3491 | 1 | my red eyes, he went on: "Ah, I see you have been comforting him. Poor
line = 3492 | 1 | old fellow! he needs it. No one but a woman can help a man when he is in
line = 3493 | 1 | trouble of the heart; and he had no one to comfort him."
line = 3494 | 1 | 
line = 3495 | 1 | He bore his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him. I saw the
line = 3496 | 1 | manuscript in his hand, and I knew that when he read it he would realise
line = 3497 | 1 | how much I knew; so I said to him:--
line = 3498 | 1 | 
line = 3499 | 1 | "I wish I could comfort all who suffer from the heart. Will you let me
line = 3500 | 1 | be your friend, and will you come to me for comfort if you need it? You
line = 3501 | 1 | will know, later on, why I speak." He saw that I was in earnest, and
line = 3502 | 1 | stooping, took my hand, and raising it to his lips, kissed it. It seemed
line = 3503 | 1 | but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul, and impulsively I
line = 3504 | 1 | bent over and kissed him. The tears rose in his eyes, and there was a
line = 3505 | 1 | momentary choking in his throat; he said quite calmly:--
line = 3506 | 1 | 
line = 3507 | 1 | "Little girl, you will never regret that true-hearted kindness, so long
line = 3508 | 1 | as ever you live!" Then he went into the study to his friend.
line = 3509 | 1 | 
line = 3510 | 1 | "Little girl!"--the very words he had used to Lucy, and oh, but he
line = 3511 | 1 | proved himself a friend!

line = 3519 | 1 | 
line = 3520 | 1 | 
line = 3521 | 1 | _30 September._--I got home at five o'clock, and found that Godalming
line = 3522 | 1 | and Morris had not only arrived, but had already studied the transcript
line = 3523 | 1 | of the various diaries and letters which Harker and his wonderful wife
line = 3524 | 1 | had made and arranged. Harker had not yet returned from his visit to the
line = 3525 | 1 | carriers' men, of whom Dr. Hennessey had written to me. Mrs. Harker gave
line = 3526 | 1 | us a cup of tea, and I can honestly say that, for the first time since I
line = 3527 | 1 | have lived in it, this old house seemed like _home_. When we had
line = 3528 | 1 | finished, Mrs. Harker said:--
line = 3529 | 1 | 
line = 3530 | 1 | "Dr. Seward, may I ask a favour? I want to see your patient, Mr.
line = 3531 | 1 | Renfield. Do let me see him. What you have said of him in your diary
line = 3532 | 1 | interests me so much!" She looked so appealing and so pretty that I
line = 3533 | 1 | could not refuse her, and there was no possible reason why I should; so
line = 3534 | 1 | I took her with me. When I went into the room, I told the man that a
line = 3535 | 1 | lady would like to see him; to which he simply answered: "Why?"
line = 3536 | 1 | 
line = 3537 | 1 | "She is going through the house, and wants to see every one in it," I
line = 3538 | 1 | answered. "Oh, very well," he said; "let her come in, by all means; but
line = 3539 | 1 | just wait a minute till I tidy up the place." His method of tidying was
line = 3540 | 1 | peculiar: he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes
line = 3541 | 1 | before I could stop him. It was quite evident that he feared, or was
line = 3542 | 1 | jealous of, some interference. When he had got through his disgusting
line = 3543 | 1 | task, he said cheerfully: "Let the lady come in," and sat down on the
line = 3544 | 1 | edge of his bed with his head down, but with his eyelids raised so that
line = 3545 | 1 | he could see her as she entered. For a moment I thought that he might
line = 3546 | 1 | have some homicidal intent; I remembered how quiet he had been just
line = 3547 | 1 | before he attacked me in my own study, and I took care to stand where I
line = 3548 | 1 | could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her. She
line = 3549 | 1 | came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command
line = 3550 | 1 | the respect of any lunatic--for easiness is one of the qualities mad
line = 3551 | 1 | people most respect. She walked over to him, smiling pleasantly, and
line = 3552 | 1 | held out her hand.
line = 3553 | 1 | 
line = 3554 | 1 | "Good-evening, Mr. Renfield," said she. "You see, I know you, for Dr.
line = 3555 | 1 | Seward has told me of you." He made no immediate reply, but eyed her all
line = 3556 | 1 | over intently with a set frown on his face. This look gave way to one
line = 3557 | 1 | of wonder, which merged in doubt; then, to my intense astonishment, he
line = 3558 | 1 | said:--
line = 3559 | 1 | 
line = 3560 | 1 | "You're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry, are you? You can't be,
line = 3561 | 1 | you know, for she's dead." Mrs. Harker smiled sweetly as she replied:--
line = 3562 | 1 | 
line = 3563 | 1 | "Oh no! I have a husband of my own, to whom I was married before I ever
line = 3564 | 1 | saw Dr. Seward, or he me. I am Mrs. Harker."
line = 3565 | 1 | 
line = 3566 | 1 | "Then what are you doing here?"
line = 3567 | 1 | 
line = 3568 | 1 | "My husband and I are staying on a visit with Dr. Seward."
line = 3569 | 1 | 
line = 3570 | 1 | "Then don't stay."
line = 3571 | 1 | 
line = 3572 | 1 | "But why not?" I thought that this style of conversation might not be
line = 3573 | 1 | pleasant to Mrs. Harker, any more than it was to me, so I joined in:--
line = 3574 | 1 | 
line = 3575 | 1 | "How did you know I wanted to marry any one?" His reply was simply
line = 3576 | 1 | contemptuous, given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from Mrs.
line = 3577 | 1 | Harker to me, instantly turning them back again:--
line = 3578 | 1 | 
line = 3579 | 1 | "What an asinine question!"
line = 3580 | 1 | 
line = 3581 | 1 | "I don't see that at all, Mr. Renfield," said Mrs. Harker, at once
line = 3582 | 1 | championing me. He replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as
line = 3583 | 1 | he had shown contempt to me:--
line = 3584 | 1 | 
line = 3585 | 1 | "You will, of course, understand, Mrs. Harker, that when a man is so
line = 3586 | 1 | loved and honoured as our host is, everything regarding him is of
line = 3587 | 1 | interest in our little community. Dr. Seward is loved not only by his
line = 3588 | 1 | household and his friends, but even by his patients, who, being some of
line = 3589 | 1 | them hardly in mental equilibrium, are apt to distort causes and
line = 3590 | 1 | effects. Since I myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum, I
line = 3591 | 1 | cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates
line = 3592 | 1 | lean towards the errors of _non causa_ and _ignoratio elenchi_." I
line = 3593 | 1 | positively opened my eyes at this new development. Here was my own pet
line = 3594 | 1 | lunatic--the most pronounced of his type that I had ever met
line = 3595 | 1 | with--talking elemental philosophy, and with the manner of a polished
line = 3596 | 1 | gentleman. I wonder if it was Mrs. Harker's presence which had touched
line = 3597 | 1 | some chord in his memory. If this new phase was spontaneous, or in any
line = 3598 | 1 | way due to her unconscious influence, she must have some rare gift or
line = 3599 | 1 | power.
line = 3600 | 1 | 
line = 3601 | 1 | We continued to talk for some time; and, seeing that he was seemingly
line = 3602 | 1 | quite reasonable, she ventured, looking at me questioningly as she
line = 3603 | 1 | began, to lead him to his favourite topic. I was again astonished, for
line = 3604 | 1 | he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the
line = 3605 | 1 | completest sanity; he even took himself as an example when he mentioned
line = 3606 | 1 | certain things.
line = 3607 | 1 | 
line = 3608 | 1 | "Why, I myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief. Indeed,
line = 3609 | 1 | it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed, and insisted on my being
line = 3610 | 1 | put under control. I used to fancy that life was a positive and
line = 3611 | 1 | perpetual entity, and that by consuming a multitude of live things, no
line = 3612 | 1 | matter how low in the scale of creation, one might indefinitely prolong
line = 3613 | 1 | life. At times I held the belief so strongly that I actually tried to
line = 3614 | 1 | take human life. The doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion I
line = 3615 | 1 | tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by
line = 3616 | 1 | the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his
line = 3617 | 1 | blood--relying, of course, upon the Scriptural phrase, 'For the blood is
line = 3618 | 1 | the life.' Though, indeed, the vendor of a certain nostrum has
line = 3619 | 1 | vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt. Isn't that true,
line = 3620 | 1 | doctor?" I nodded assent, for I was so amazed that I hardly knew what to
line = 3621 | 1 | either think or say; it was hard to imagine that I had seen him eat up
line = 3622 | 1 | his spiders and flies not five minutes before. Looking at my watch, I
line = 3623 | 1 | saw that I should go to the station to meet Van Helsing, so I told Mrs.
line = 3624 | 1 | Harker that it was time to leave. She came at once, after saying
line = 3625 | 1 | pleasantly to Mr. Renfield: "Good-bye, and I hope I may see you often,
line = 3626 | 1 | under auspices pleasanter to yourself," to which, to my astonishment, he
line = 3627 | 1 | replied:--
line = 3628 | 1 | 
line = 3629 | 1 | "Good-bye, my dear. I pray God I may never see your sweet face again.
line = 3630 | 1 | May He bless and keep you!"
line = 3631 | 1 | 
line = 3632 | 1 | When I went to the station to meet Van Helsing I left the boys behind
line = 3633 | 1 | me. Poor Art seemed more cheerful than he has been since Lucy first took
line = 3634 | 1 | ill, and Quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for
line = 3635 | 1 | many a long day.
line = 3636 | 1 | 
line = 3637 | 1 | Van Helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimbleness of a
line = 3638 | 1 | boy. He saw me at once, and rushed up to me, saying:--
line = 3639 | 1 | 
line = 3640 | 1 | "Ah, friend John, how goes all? Well? So! I have been busy, for I come
line = 3641 | 1 | here to stay if need be. All affairs are settled with me, and I have
line = 3642 | 1 | much to tell. Madam Mina is with you? Yes. And her so fine husband? And
line = 3643 | 1 | Arthur and my friend Quincey, they are with you, too? Good!"
line = 3644 | 1 | 
line = 3645 | 1 | As I drove to the house I told him of what had passed, and of how my own
line = 3646 | 1 | diary had come to be of some use through Mrs. Harker's suggestion; at
line = 3647 | 1 | which the Professor interrupted me:--
line = 3648 | 1 | 
line = 3649 | 1 | "Ah, that wonderful Madam Mina! She has man's brain--a brain that a man
line = 3650 | 1 | should have were he much gifted--and a woman's heart. The good God
line = 3651 | 1 | fashioned her for a purpose, believe me, when He made that so good
line = 3652 | 1 | combination. Friend John, up to now fortune has made that woman of help
line = 3653 | 1 | to us; after to-night she must not have to do with this so terrible
line = 3654 | 1 | affair. It is not good that she run a risk so great. We men are
line = 3655 | 1 | determined--nay, are we not pledged?--to destroy this monster; but it is
line = 3656 | 1 | no part for a woman. Even if she be not harmed, her heart may fail her
line = 3657 | 1 | in so much and so many horrors; and hereafter she may suffer--both in
line = 3658 | 1 | waking, from her nerves, and in sleep, from her dreams. And, besides,
line = 3659 | 1 | she is young woman and not so long married; there may be other things to
line = 3660 | 1 | think of some time, if not now. You tell me she has wrote all, then she
line = 3661 | 1 | must consult with us; but to-morrow she say good-bye to this work, and
line = 3662 | 1 | we go alone." I agreed heartily with him, and then I told him what we
line = 3663 | 1 | had found in his absence: that the house which Dracula had bought was
line = 3664 | 1 | the very next one to my own. He was amazed, and a great concern seemed
line = 3665 | 1 | to come on him. "Oh that we had known it before!" he said, "for then we
line = 3666 | 1 | might have reached him in time to save poor Lucy. However, 'the milk
line = 3667 | 1 | that is spilt cries not out afterwards,' as you say. We shall not think
line = 3668 | 1 | of that, but go on our way to the end." Then he fell into a silence that
line = 3669 | 1 | lasted till we entered my own gateway. Before we went to prepare for
line = 3670 | 1 | dinner he said to Mrs. Harker:--
line = 3671 | 1 | 
line = 3672 | 1 | "I am told, Madam Mina, by my friend John that you and your husband have
line = 3673 | 1 | put up in exact order all things that have been, up to this moment."
line = 3674 | 1 | 
line = 3675 | 1 | "Not up to this moment, Professor," she said impulsively, "but up to
line = 3676 | 1 | this morning."
line = 3677 | 1 | 
line = 3678 | 1 | "But why not up to now? We have seen hitherto how good light all the
line = 3679 | 1 | little things have made. We have told our secrets, and yet no one who
line = 3680 | 1 | has told is the worse for it."
line = 3681 | 1 | 
line = 3682 | 1 | Mrs. Harker began to blush, and taking a paper from her pockets, she
line = 3683 | 1 | said:--
line = 3684 | 1 | 
line = 3685 | 1 | "Dr. Van Helsing, will you read this, and tell me if it must go in. It
line = 3686 | 1 | is my record of to-day. I too have seen the need of putting down at
line = 3687 | 1 | present everything, however trivial; but there is little in this except
line = 3688 | 1 | what is personal. Must it go in?" The Professor read it over gravely,
line = 3689 | 1 | and handed it back, saying:--
line = 3690 | 1 | 
line = 3691 | 1 | "It need not go in if you do not wish it; but I pray that it may. It can
line = 3692 | 1 | but make your husband love you the more, and all us, your friends, more
line = 3693 | 1 | honour you--as well as more esteem and love." She took it back with
line = 3694 | 1 | another blush and a bright smile.
line = 3695 | 1 | 
line = 3696 | 1 | And so now, up to this very hour, all the records we have are complete
line = 3697 | 1 | and in order. The Professor took away one copy to study after dinner,
line = 3698 | 1 | and before our meeting, which is fixed for nine o'clock. The rest of us
line = 3699 | 1 | have already read everything; so when we meet in the study we shall all
line = 3700 | 1 | be informed as to facts, and can arrange our plan of battle with this
line = 3701 | 1 | terrible and mysterious enemy.
line = 3702 | 1 | 
line = 3703 | 1 | 
line = 3704 | 1 | _Mina Harker's Journal._
line = 3705 | 1 | 
line = 3706 | 1 | _30 September._--When we met in Dr. Seward's study two hours after
line = 3707 | 1 | dinner, which had been at six o'clock, we unconsciously formed a sort of
line = 3708 | 1 | board or committee. Professor Van Helsing took the head of the table, to
line = 3709 | 1 | which Dr. Seward motioned him as he came into the room. He made me sit
line = 3710 | 1 | next to him on his right, and asked me to act as secretary; Jonathan sat
line = 3711 | 1 | next to me. Opposite us were Lord Godalming, Dr. Seward, and Mr.
line = 3712 | 1 | Morris--Lord Godalming being next the Professor, and Dr. Seward in the
line = 3713 | 1 | centre. The Professor said:--
line = 3714 | 1 | 
line = 3715 | 1 | "I may, I suppose, take it that we are all acquainted with the facts
line = 3716 | 1 | that are in these papers." We all expressed assent, and he went on:--
line = 3717 | 1 | 
line = 3718 | 1 | "Then it were, I think good that I tell you something of the kind of
line = 3719 | 1 | enemy with which we have to deal. I shall then make known to you
line = 3720 | 1 | something of the history of this man, which has been ascertained for me.
line = 3721 | 1 | So we then can discuss how we shall act, and can take our measure
line = 3722 | 1 | according.
line = 3723 | 1 | 
line = 3724 | 1 | "There are such beings as vampires; some of us have evidence that they
line = 3725 | 1 | exist. Even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience, the
line = 3726 | 1 | teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane
line = 3727 | 1 | peoples. I admit that at the first I was sceptic. Were it not that
line = 3728 | 1 | through long years I have train myself to keep an open mind, I could not
line = 3729 | 1 | have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear. 'See! see!
line = 3730 | 1 | I prove; I prove.' Alas! Had I known at the first what now I know--nay,
line = 3731 | 1 | had I even guess at him--one so precious life had been spared to many of
line = 3732 | 1 | us who did love her. But that is gone; and we must so work, that other
line = 3733 | 1 | poor souls perish not, whilst we can save. The _nosferatu_ do not die
line = 3734 | 1 | like the bee when he sting once. He is only stronger; and being
line = 3735 | 1 | stronger, have yet more power to work evil. This vampire which is
line = 3736 | 1 | amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men; he is of
line = 3737 | 1 | cunning more than mortal, for his cunning be the growth of ages; he have
line = 3738 | 1 | still the aids of necromancy, which is, as his etymology imply, the
line = 3739 | 1 | divination by the dead, and all the dead that he can come nigh to are
line = 3740 | 1 | for him at command; he is brute, and more than brute; he is devil in
line = 3741 | 1 | callous, and the heart of him is not; he can, within limitations, appear
line = 3742 | 1 | at will when, and where, and in any of the forms that are to him; he
line = 3743 | 1 | can, within his range, direct the elements; the storm, the fog, the
line = 3744 | 1 | thunder; he can command all the meaner things: the rat, and the owl, and
line = 3745 | 1 | the bat--the moth, and the fox, and the wolf; he can grow and become
line = 3746 | 1 | small; and he can at times vanish and come unknown. How then are we to
line = 3747 | 1 | begin our strike to destroy him? How shall we find his where; and having
line = 3748 | 1 | found it, how can we destroy? My friends, this is much; it is a terrible
line = 3749 | 1 | task that we undertake, and there may be consequence to make the brave
line = 3750 | 1 | shudder. For if we fail in this our fight he must surely win; and then
line = 3751 | 1 | where end we? Life is nothings; I heed him not. But to fail here, is not
line = 3752 | 1 | mere life or death. It is that we become as him; that we henceforward
line = 3753 | 1 | become foul things of the night like him--without heart or conscience,
line = 3754 | 1 | preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best. To us for
line = 3755 | 1 | ever are the gates of heaven shut; for who shall open them to us again?
line = 3756 | 1 | We go on for all time abhorred by all; a blot on the face of God's
line = 3757 | 1 | sunshine; an arrow in the side of Him who died for man. But we are face
line = 3758 | 1 | to face with duty; and in such case must we shrink? For me, I say, no;
line = 3759 | 1 | but then I am old, and life, with his sunshine, his fair places, his
line = 3760 | 1 | song of birds, his music and his love, lie far behind. You others are
line = 3761 | 1 | young. Some have seen sorrow; but there are fair days yet in store. What
line = 3762 | 1 | say you?"
line = 3763 | 1 | 
line = 3764 | 1 | Whilst he was speaking, Jonathan had taken my hand. I feared, oh so
line = 3765 | 1 | much, that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when I
line = 3766 | 1 | saw his hand stretch out; but it was life to me to feel its touch--so
line = 3767 | 1 | strong, so self-reliant, so resolute. A brave man's hand can speak for
line = 3768 | 1 | itself; it does not even need a woman's love to hear its music.
line = 3769 | 1 | 
line = 3770 | 1 | When the Professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes, and I
line = 3771 | 1 | in his; there was no need for speaking between us.
line = 3772 | 1 | 
line = 3773 | 1 | "I answer for Mina and myself," he said.
line = 3774 | 1 | 
line = 3775 | 1 | "Count me in, Professor," said Mr. Quincey Morris, laconically as usual.
line = 3776 | 1 | 
line = 3777 | 1 | "I am with you," said Lord Godalming, "for Lucy's sake, if for no other
line = 3778 | 1 | reason."
line = 3779 | 1 | 
line = 3780 | 1 | Dr. Seward simply nodded. The Professor stood up and, after laying his
line = 3781 | 1 | golden crucifix on the table, held out his hand on either side. I took
line = 3782 | 1 | his right hand, and Lord Godalming his left; Jonathan held my right with
line = 3783 | 1 | his left and stretched across to Mr. Morris. So as we all took hands our
line = 3784 | 1 | solemn compact was made. I felt my heart icy cold, but it did not even
line = 3785 | 1 | occur to me to draw back. We resumed our places, and Dr. Van Helsing
line = 3786 | 1 | went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work
line = 3787 | 1 | had begun. It was to be taken as gravely, and in as businesslike a way,
line = 3788 | 1 | as any other transaction of life:--
line = 3789 | 1 | 
line = 3790 | 1 | "Well, you know what we have to contend against; but we, too, are not
line = 3791 | 1 | without strength. We have on our side power of combination--a power
line = 3792 | 1 | denied to the vampire kind; we have sources of science; we are free to
line = 3793 | 1 | act and think; and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally.
line = 3794 | 1 | In fact, so far as our powers extend, they are unfettered, and we are
line = 3795 | 1 | free to use them. We have self-devotion in a cause, and an end to
line = 3796 | 1 | achieve which is not a selfish one. These things are much.
line = 3797 | 1 | 
line = 3798 | 1 | "Now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are
line = 3799 | 1 | restrict, and how the individual cannot. In fine, let us consider the
line = 3800 | 1 | limitations of the vampire in general, and of this one in particular.
line = 3801 | 1 | 
line = 3802 | 1 | "All we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions. These do not
line = 3803 | 1 | at the first appear much, when the matter is one of life and death--nay
line = 3804 | 1 | of more than either life or death. Yet must we be satisfied; in the
line = 3805 | 1 | first place because we have to be--no other means is at our control--and
line = 3806 | 1 | secondly, because, after all, these things--tradition and
line = 3807 | 1 | superstition--are everything. Does not the belief in vampires rest for
line = 3808 | 1 | others--though not, alas! for us--on them? A year ago which of us would
line = 3809 | 1 | have received such a possibility, in the midst of our scientific,
line = 3810 | 1 | sceptical, matter-of-fact nineteenth century? We even scouted a belief
line = 3811 | 1 | that we saw justified under our very eyes. Take it, then, that the
line = 3812 | 1 | vampire, and the belief in his limitations and his cure, rest for the
line = 3813 | 1 | moment on the same base. For, let me tell you, he is known everywhere
line = 3814 | 1 | that men have been. In old Greece, in old Rome; he flourish in Germany
line = 3815 | 1 | all over, in France, in India, even in the Chernosese; and in China, so
line = 3816 | 1 | far from us in all ways, there even is he, and the peoples fear him at
line = 3817 | 1 | this day. He have follow the wake of the berserker Icelander, the
line = 3818 | 1 | devil-begotten Hun, the Slav, the Saxon, the Magyar. So far, then, we
line = 3819 | 1 | have all we may act upon; and let me tell you that very much of the
line = 3820 | 1 | beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy
line = 3821 | 1 | experience. The vampire live on, and cannot die by mere passing of the
line = 3822 | 1 | time; he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the
line = 3823 | 1 | living. Even more, we have seen amongst us that he can even grow
line = 3824 | 1 | younger; that his vital faculties grow strenuous, and seem as though
line = 3825 | 1 | they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty. But he
line = 3826 | 1 | cannot flourish without this diet; he eat not as others. Even friend
line = 3827 | 1 | Jonathan, who lived with him for weeks, did never see him to eat, never!
line = 3828 | 1 | He throws no shadow; he make in the mirror no reflect, as again
line = 3829 | 1 | Jonathan observe. He has the strength of many of his hand--witness again
line = 3830 | 1 | Jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs, and when he help him
line = 3831 | 1 | from the diligence too. He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather
line = 3832 | 1 | from the ship arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
line = 3833 | 1 | bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as friend John
line = 3834 | 1 | saw him fly from this so near house, and as my friend Quincey saw him at
line = 3835 | 1 | the window of Miss Lucy. He can come in mist which he create--that noble
line = 3836 | 1 | ship's captain proved him of this; but, from what we know, the distance
line = 3837 | 1 | he can make this mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He
line = 3838 | 1 | come on moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those
line = 3839 | 1 | sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we ourselves saw
line = 3840 | 1 | Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a hairbreadth space at the
line = 3841 | 1 | tomb door. He can, when once he find his way, come out from anything or
line = 3842 | 1 | into anything, no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with
line = 3843 | 1 | fire--solder you call it. He can see in the dark--no small power this,
line = 3844 | 1 | in a world which is one half shut from the light. Ah, but hear me
line = 3845 | 1 | through. He can do all these things, yet he is not free. Nay; he is even
line = 3846 | 1 | more prisoner than the slave of the galley, than the madman in his cell.
line = 3847 | 1 | He cannot go where he lists; he who is not of nature has yet to obey
line = 3848 | 1 | some of nature's laws--why we know not. He may not enter anywhere at the
line = 3849 | 1 | first, unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come;
line = 3850 | 1 | though afterwards he can come as he please. His power ceases, as does
line = 3851 | 1 | that of all evil things, at the coming of the day. Only at certain times
line = 3852 | 1 | can he have limited freedom. If he be not at the place whither he is
line = 3853 | 1 | bound, he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset.
line = 3854 | 1 | These things are we told, and in this record of ours we have proof by
line = 3855 | 1 | inference. Thus, whereas he can do as he will within his limit, when he
line = 3856 | 1 | have his earth-home, his coffin-home, his hell-home, the place
line = 3857 | 1 | unhallowed, as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at
line = 3858 | 1 | Whitby; still at other time he can only change when the time come. It is
line = 3859 | 1 | said, too, that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood
line = 3860 | 1 | of the tide. Then there are things which so afflict him that he has no
line = 3861 | 1 | power, as the garlic that we know of; and as for things sacred, as this
line = 3862 | 1 | symbol, my crucifix, that was amongst us even now when we resolve, to
line = 3863 | 1 | them he is nothing, but in their presence he take his place far off and
line = 3864 | 1 | silent with respect. There are others, too, which I shall tell you of,
line = 3865 | 1 | lest in our seeking we may need them. The branch of wild rose on his
line = 3866 | 1 | coffin keep him that he move not from it; a sacred bullet fired into the
line = 3867 | 1 | coffin kill him so that he be true dead; and as for the stake through
line = 3868 | 1 | him, we know already of its peace; or the cut-off head that giveth rest.
line = 3869 | 1 | We have seen it with our eyes.
line = 3870 | 1 | 
line = 3871 | 1 | "Thus when we find the habitation of this man-that-was, we can confine
line = 3872 | 1 | him to his coffin and destroy him, if we obey what we know. But he is
line = 3873 | 1 | clever. I have asked my friend Arminius, of Buda-Pesth University, to
line = 3874 | 1 | make his record; and, from all the means that are, he tell me of what he
line = 3875 | 1 | has been. He must, indeed, have been that Voivode Dracula who won his
line = 3876 | 1 | name against the Turk, over the great river on the very frontier of
line = 3877 | 1 | Turkey-land. If it be so, then was he no common man; for in that time,
line = 3878 | 1 | and for centuries after, he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most
line = 3879 | 1 | cunning, as well as the bravest of the sons of the 'land beyond the
line = 3880 | 1 | forest.' That mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his
line = 3881 | 1 | grave, and are even now arrayed against us. The Draculas were, says
line = 3882 | 1 | Arminius, a great and noble race, though now and again were scions who
line = 3883 | 1 | were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the Evil One. They
line = 3884 | 1 | learned his secrets in the Scholomance, amongst the mountains over Lake
line = 3885 | 1 | Hermanstadt, where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due. In the
line = 3886 | 1 | records are such words as 'stregoica'--witch, 'ordog,' and
line = 3887 | 1 | 'pokol'--Satan and hell; and in one manuscript this very Dracula is
line = 3888 | 1 | spoken of as 'wampyr,' which we all understand too well. There have been
line = 3889 | 1 | from the loins of this very one great men and good women, and their
line = 3890 | 1 | graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell. For it
line = 3891 | 1 | is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in
line = 3892 | 1 | all good; in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest."
line = 3893 | 1 | 
line = 3894 | 1 | Whilst they were talking Mr. Morris was looking steadily at the window,
line = 3895 | 1 | and he now got up quietly, and went out of the room. There was a little
line = 3896 | 1 | pause, and then the Professor went on:--
line = 3897 | 1 | 
line = 3898 | 1 | "And now we must settle what we do. We have here much data, and we must
line = 3899 | 1 | proceed to lay out our campaign. We know from the inquiry of Jonathan
line = 3900 | 1 | that from the castle to Whitby came fifty boxes of earth, all of which
line = 3901 | 1 | were delivered at Carfax; we also know that at least some of these boxes
line = 3902 | 1 | have been removed. It seems to me, that our first step should be to
line = 3903 | 1 | ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall
line = 3904 | 1 | where we look to-day; or whether any more have been removed. If the
line = 3905 | 1 | latter, we must trace----"
line = 3906 | 1 | 
line = 3907 | 1 | Here we were interrupted in a very startling way. Outside the house came
line = 3908 | 1 | the sound of a pistol-shot; the glass of the window was shattered with a
line = 3909 | 1 | bullet, which, ricochetting from the top of the embrasure, struck the
line = 3910 | 1 | far wall of the room. I am afraid I am at heart a coward, for I shrieked
line = 3911 | 1 | out. The men all jumped to their feet; Lord Godalming flew over to the
line = 3912 | 1 | window and threw up the sash. As he did so we heard Mr. Morris's voice
line = 3913 | 1 | without:--
line = 3914 | 1 | 
line = 3915 | 1 | "Sorry! I fear I have alarmed you. I shall come in and tell you about
line = 3916 | 1 | it." A minute later he came in and said:--
line = 3917 | 1 | 
line = 3918 | 1 | "It was an idiotic thing of me to do, and I ask your pardon, Mrs.
line = 3919 | 1 | Harker, most sincerely; I fear I must have frightened you terribly. But
line = 3920 | 1 | the fact is that whilst the Professor was talking there came a big bat
line = 3921 | 1 | and sat on the window-sill. I have got such a horror of the damned
line = 3922 | 1 | brutes from recent events that I cannot stand them, and I went out to
line = 3923 | 1 | have a shot, as I have been doing of late of evenings, whenever I have
line = 3924 | 1 | seen one. You used to laugh at me for it then, Art."
line = 3925 | 1 | 
line = 3926 | 1 | "Did you hit it?" asked Dr. Van Helsing.
line = 3927 | 1 | 
line = 3928 | 1 | "I don't know; I fancy not, for it flew away into the wood." Without
line = 3929 | 1 | saying any more he took his seat, and the Professor began to resume his
line = 3930 | 1 | statement:--
line = 3931 | 1 | 
line = 3932 | 1 | "We must trace each of these boxes; and when we are ready, we must
line = 3933 | 1 | either capture or kill this monster in his lair; or we must, so to
line = 3934 | 1 | speak, sterilise the earth, so that no more he can seek safety in it.
line = 3935 | 1 | Thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of
line = 3936 | 1 | noon and sunset, and so engage with him when he is at his most weak.
line = 3937 | 1 | 
line = 3938 | 1 | "And now for you, Madam Mina, this night is the end until all be well.
line = 3939 | 1 | You are too precious to us to have such risk. When we part to-night, you
line = 3940 | 1 | no more must question. We shall tell you all in good time. We are men
line = 3941 | 1 | and are able to bear; but you must be our star and our hope, and we
line = 3942 | 1 | shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger, such as we
line = 3943 | 1 | are."
line = 3944 | 1 | 
line = 3945 | 1 | All the men, even Jonathan, seemed relieved; but it did not seem to me
line = 3946 | 1 | good that they should brave danger and, perhaps, lessen their
line = 3947 | 1 | safety--strength being the best safety--through care of me; but their
line = 3948 | 1 | minds were made up, and, though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow,
line = 3949 | 1 | I could say nothing, save to accept their chivalrous care of me.
line = 3950 | 1 | 
line = 3951 | 1 | Mr. Morris resumed the discussion:--
line = 3952 | 1 | 
line = 3953 | 1 | "As there is no time to lose, I vote we have a look at his house right
line = 3954 | 1 | now. Time is everything with him; and swift action on our part may save
line = 3955 | 1 | another victim."
line = 3956 | 1 | 
line = 3957 | 1 | I own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so
line = 3958 | 1 | close, but I did not say anything, for I had a greater fear that if I
line = 3959 | 1 | appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work, they might even leave
line = 3960 | 1 | me out of their counsels altogether. They have now gone off to Carfax,
line = 3961 | 1 | with means to get into the house.
line = 3962 | 1 | 
line = 3963 | 1 | Manlike, they had told me to go to bed and sleep; as if a woman can
line = 3964 | 1 | sleep when those she loves are in danger! I shall lie down and pretend
line = 3965 | 1 | to sleep, lest Jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns.
line = 3966 | 1 | 
line = 3967 | 1 | 
line = 3968 | 1 | _Dr. Seward's Diary._
line = 3969 | 1 | 
line = 3970 | 1 | _1 October, 4 a. m._--Just as we were about to leave the house, an
line = 3971 | 1 | urgent message was brought to me from Renfield to know if I would see
line = 3972 | 1 | him at once, as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me.
line = 3973 | 1 | I told the messenger to say that I would attend to his wishes in the
line = 3974 | 1 | morning; I was busy just at the moment. The attendant added:--
line = 3975 | 1 | 
line = 3976 | 1 | "He seems very importunate, sir. I have never seen him so eager. I don't
line = 3977 | 1 | know but what, if you don't see him soon, he will have one of his
line = 3978 | 1 | violent fits." I knew the man would not have said this without some
line = 3979 | 1 | cause, so I said: "All right; I'll go now"; and I asked the others to
line = 3980 | 1 | wait a few minutes for me, as I had to go and see my "patient."
line = 3981 | 1 | 
line = 3982 | 1 | "Take me with you, friend John," said the Professor. "His case in your
line = 3983 | 1 | diary interest me much, and it had bearing, too, now and again on _our_
line = 3984 | 1 | case. I should much like to see him, and especial when his mind is
line = 3985 | 1 | disturbed."
line = 3986 | 1 | 
line = 3987 | 1 | "May I come also?" asked Lord Godalming.
line = 3988 | 1 | 
line = 3989 | 1 | "Me too?" said Quincey Morris. "May I come?" said Harker. I nodded, and
line = 3990 | 1 | we all went down the passage together.
line = 3991 | 1 | 
line = 3992 | 1 | We found him in a state of considerable excitement, but far more
line = 3993 | 1 | rational in his speech and manner than I had ever seen him. There was an
line = 3994 | 1 | unusual understanding of himself, which was unlike anything I had ever
line = 3995 | 1 | met with in a lunatic; and he took it for granted that his reasons would
line = 3996 | 1 | prevail with others entirely sane. We all four went into the room, but
line = 3997 | 1 | none of the others at first said anything. His request was that I would
line = 3998 | 1 | at once release him from the asylum and send him home. This he backed up
line = 3999 | 1 | with arguments regarding his complete recovery, and adduced his own
line = 4000 | 1 | existing sanity. "I appeal to your friends," he said, "they will,
line = 4001 | 1 | perhaps, not mind sitting in judgment on my case. By the way, you have
line = 4002 | 1 | not introduced me." I was so much astonished, that the oddness of
line = 4003 | 1 | introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment; and,
line = 4004 | 1 | besides, there was a certain dignity in the man's manner, so much of
line = 4005 | 1 | the habit of equality, that I at once made the introduction: "Lord
line = 4006 | 1 | Godalming; Professor Van Helsing; Mr. Quincey Morris, of Texas; Mr.
line = 4007 | 1 | Renfield." He shook hands with each of them, saying in turn:--
line = 4008 | 1 | 
line = 4009 | 1 | "Lord Godalming, I had the honour of seconding your father at the
line = 4010 | 1 | Windham; I grieve to know, by your holding the title, that he is no
line = 4011 | 1 | more. He was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him; and in his
line = 4012 | 1 | youth was, I have heard, the inventor of a burnt rum punch, much
line = 4013 | 1 | patronised on Derby night. Mr. Morris, you should be proud of your great
line = 4014 | 1 | state. Its reception into the Union was a precedent which may have
line = 4015 | 1 | far-reaching effects hereafter, when the Pole and the Tropics may hold
line = 4016 | 1 | alliance to the Stars and Stripes. The power of Treaty may yet prove a
line = 4017 | 1 | vast engine of enlargement, when the Monroe doctrine takes its true
line = 4018 | 1 | place as a political fable. What shall any man say of his pleasure at
line = 4019 | 1 | meeting Van Helsing? Sir, I make no apology for dropping all forms of
line = 4020 | 1 | conventional prefix. When an individual has revolutionised therapeutics
line = 4021 | 1 | by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain-matter,
line = 4022 | 1 | conventional forms are unfitting, since they would seem to limit him to
line = 4023 | 1 | one of a class. You, gentlemen, who by nationality, by heredity, or by
line = 4024 | 1 | the possession of natural gifts, are fitted to hold your respective
line = 4025 | 1 | places in the moving world, I take to witness that I am as sane as at
line = 4026 | 1 | least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties.
line = 4027 | 1 | And I am sure that you, Dr. Seward, humanitarian and medico-jurist as
line = 4028 | 1 | well as scientist, will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to
line = 4029 | 1 | be considered as under exceptional circumstances." He made this last
line = 4030 | 1 | appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own
line = 4031 | 1 | charm.
line = 4032 | 1 | 
line = 4033 | 1 | I think we were all staggered. For my own part, I was under the
line = 4034 | 1 | conviction, despite my knowledge of the man's character and history,
line = 4035 | 1 | that his reason had been restored; and I felt under a strong impulse to
line = 4036 | 1 | tell him that I was satisfied as to his sanity, and would see about the
line = 4037 | 1 | necessary formalities for his release in the morning. I thought it
line = 4038 | 1 | better to wait, however, before making so grave a statement, for of old
line = 4039 | 1 | I knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable.
line = 4040 | 1 | So I contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared
line = 4041 | 1 | to be improving very rapidly; that I would have a longer chat with him
line = 4042 | 1 | in the morning, and would then see what I could do in the direction of
line = 4043 | 1 | meeting his wishes. This did not at all satisfy him, for he said
line = 4044 | 1 | quickly:--
line = 4045 | 1 | 
line = 4046 | 1 | "But I fear, Dr. Seward, that you hardly apprehend my wish. I desire to
line = 4047 | 1 | go at once--here--now--this very hour--this very moment, if I may. Time
line = 4048 | 1 | presses, and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of
line = 4049 | 1 | the essence of the contract. I am sure it is only necessary to put
line = 4050 | 1 | before so admirable a practitioner as Dr. Seward so simple, yet so
line = 4051 | 1 | momentous a wish, to ensure its fulfilment." He looked at me keenly, and
line = 4052 | 1 | seeing the negative in my face, turned to the others, and scrutinised
line = 4053 | 1 | them closely. Not meeting any sufficient response, he went on:--
line = 4054 | 1 | 
line = 4055 | 1 | "Is it possible that I have erred in my supposition?"
line = 4056 | 1 | 
line = 4057 | 1 | "You have," I said frankly, but at the same time, as I felt, brutally.
line = 4058 | 1 | There was a considerable pause, and then he said slowly:--
line = 4059 | 1 | 
line = 4060 | 1 | "Then I suppose I must only shift my ground of request. Let me ask for
line = 4061 | 1 | this concession--boon, privilege, what you will. I am content to implore
line = 4062 | 1 | in such a case, not on personal grounds, but for the sake of others. I
line = 4063 | 1 | am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons; but you may, I
line = 4064 | 1 | assure you, take it from me that they are good ones, sound and
line = 4065 | 1 | unselfish, and spring from the highest sense of duty. Could you look,
line = 4066 | 1 | sir, into my heart, you would approve to the full the sentiments which
line = 4067 | 1 | animate me. Nay, more, you would count me amongst the best and truest of
line = 4068 | 1 | your friends." Again he looked at us all keenly. I had a growing
line = 4069 | 1 | conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was
line = 4070 | 1 | but yet another form or phase of his madness, and so determined to let
line = 4071 | 1 | him go on a little longer, knowing from experience that he would, like
line = 4072 | 1 | all lunatics, give himself away in the end. Van Helsing was gazing at
line = 4073 | 1 | him with a look of utmost intensity, his bushy eyebrows almost meeting
line = 4074 | 1 | with the fixed concentration of his look. He said to Renfield in a tone
line = 4075 | 1 | which did not surprise me at the time, but only when I thought of it
line = 4076 | 1 | afterwards--for it was as of one addressing an equal:--
line = 4077 | 1 | 
line = 4078 | 1 | "Can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free
line = 4079 | 1 | to-night? I will undertake that if you will satisfy even me--a stranger,
line = 4080 | 1 | without prejudice, and with the habit of keeping an open mind--Dr.
line = 4081 | 1 | Seward will give you, at his own risk and on his own responsibility, the
line = 4082 | 1 | privilege you seek." He shook his head sadly, and with a look of
line = 4083 | 1 | poignant regret on his face. The Professor went on:--
line = 4084 | 1 | 
line = 4085 | 1 | "Come, sir, bethink yourself. You claim the privilege of reason in the
line = 4086 | 1 | highest degree, since you seek to impress us with your complete
line = 4087 | 1 | reasonableness. You do this, whose sanity we have reason to doubt, since
line = 4088 | 1 | you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect. If
line = 4089 | 1 | you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course, how can
line = 4090 | 1 | we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us? Be wise, and help
line = 4091 | 1 | us; and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish." He still shook
line = 4092 | 1 | his head as he said:--
line = 4093 | 1 | 
line = 4094 | 1 | "Dr. Van Helsing, I have nothing to say. Your argument is complete, and
line = 4095 | 1 | if I were free to speak I should not hesitate a moment; but I am not my
line = 4096 | 1 | own master in the matter. I can only ask you to trust me. If I am
line = 4097 | 1 | refused, the responsibility does not rest with me." I thought it was now
line = 4098 | 1 | time to end the scene, which was becoming too comically grave, so I went
line = 4099 | 1 | towards the door, simply saying:--
line = 4100 | 1 | 
line = 4101 | 1 | "Come, my friends, we have work to do. Good-night."
line = 4102 | 1 | 
line = 4103 | 1 | As, however, I got near the door, a new change came over the patient. He
line = 4104 | 1 | moved towards me so quickly that for the moment I feared that he was
line = 4105 | 1 | about to make another homicidal attack. My fears, however, were
line = 4106 | 1 | groundless, for he held up his two hands imploringly, and made his
line = 4107 | 1 | petition in a moving manner. As he saw that the very excess of his
line = 4108 | 1 | emotion was militating against him, by restoring us more to our old
line = 4109 | 1 | relations, he became still more demonstrative. I glanced at Van Helsing,
line = 4110 | 1 | and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes; so I became a little more
line = 4111 | 1 | fixed in my manner, if not more stern, and motioned to him that his
line = 4112 | 1 | efforts were unavailing. I had previously seen something of the same
line = 4113 | 1 | constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of
line = 4114 | 1 | which at the time he had thought much, such, for instance, as when he
line = 4115 | 1 | wanted a cat; and I was prepared to see the collapse into the same
line = 4116 | 1 | sullen acquiescence on this occasion. My expectation was not realised,
line = 4117 | 1 | for, when he found that his appeal would not be successful, he got into
line = 4118 | 1 | quite a frantic condition. He threw himself on his knees, and held up
line = 4119 | 1 | his hands, wringing them in plaintive supplication, and poured forth a
line = 4120 | 1 | torrent of entreaty, with the tears rolling down his cheeks, and his
line = 4121 | 1 | whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion:--
line = 4122 | 1 | 
line = 4123 | 1 | "Let me entreat you, Dr. Seward, oh, let me implore you, to let me out
line = 4124 | 1 | of this house at once. Send me away how you will and where you will;
line = 4125 | 1 | send keepers with me with whips and chains; let them take me in a
line = 4126 | 1 | strait-waistcoat, manacled and leg-ironed, even to a gaol; but let me go
line = 4127 | 1 | out of this. You don't know what you do by keeping me here. I am
line = 4128 | 1 | speaking from the depths of my heart--of my very soul. You don't know
line = 4129 | 1 | whom you wrong, or how; and I may not tell. Woe is me! I may not tell.
line = 4130 | 1 | By all you hold sacred--by all you hold dear--by your love that is
line = 4131 | 1 | lost--by your hope that lives--for the sake of the Almighty, take me out
line = 4132 | 1 | of this and save my soul from guilt! Can't you hear me, man? Can't you
line = 4133 | 1 | understand? Will you never learn? Don't you know that I am sane and
line = 4134 | 1 | earnest now; that I am no lunatic in a mad fit, but a sane man fighting
line = 4135 | 1 | for his soul? Oh, hear me! hear me! Let me go! let me go! let me go!"
line = 4136 | 1 | 
line = 4137 | 1 | I thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get, and so
line = 4138 | 1 | would bring on a fit; so I took him by the hand and raised him up.
line = 4139 | 1 | 
line = 4140 | 1 | "Come," I said sternly, "no more of this; we have had quite enough
line = 4141 | 1 | already. Get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly."
line = 4142 | 1 | 
line = 4143 | 1 | He suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments. Then,
line = 4144 | 1 | without a word, he rose and moving over, sat down on the side of the
line = 4145 | 1 | bed. The collapse had come, as on former occasion, just as I had
line = 4146 | 1 | expected.
line = 4147 | 1 | 
line = 4148 | 1 | When I was leaving the room, last of our party, he said to me in a
line = 4149 | 1 | quiet, well-bred voice:--
line = 4150 | 1 | 
line = 4151 | 1 | "You will, I trust, Dr. Seward, do me the justice to bear in mind, later
line = 4152 | 1 | on, that I did what I could to convince you to-night."
line = 4153 | 1 |

line = 4159 | 1 | JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL
line = 4160 | 1 | 
line = 4161 | 1 | 
line = 4162 | 1 | _1 October, 5 a. m._--I went with the party to the search with an easy
line = 4163 | 1 | mind, for I think I never saw Mina so absolutely strong and well. I am
line = 4164 | 1 | so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work.
line = 4165 | 1 | Somehow, it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at
line = 4166 | 1 | all; but now that her work is done, and that it is due to her energy and
line = 4167 | 1 | brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way
line = 4168 | 1 | that every point tells, she may well feel that her part is finished, and
line = 4169 | 1 | that she can henceforth leave the rest to us. We were, I think, all a
line = 4170 | 1 | little upset by the scene with Mr. Renfield. When we came away from his
line = 4171 | 1 | room we were silent till we got back to the study. Then Mr. Morris said
line = 4172 | 1 | to Dr. Seward:--
line = 4173 | 1 | 
line = 4174 | 1 | "Say, Jack, if that man wasn't attempting a bluff, he is about the
line = 4175 | 1 | sanest lunatic I ever saw. I'm not sure, but I believe that he had some
line = 4176 | 1 | serious purpose, and if he had, it was pretty rough on him not to get a
line = 4177 | 1 | chance." Lord Godalming and I were silent, but Dr. Van Helsing added:--
line = 4178 | 1 | 
line = 4179 | 1 | "Friend John, you know more of lunatics than I do, and I'm glad of it,
line = 4180 | 1 | for I fear that if it had been to me to decide I would before that last
line = 4181 | 1 | hysterical outburst have given him free. But we live and learn, and in
line = 4182 | 1 | our present task we must take no chance, as my friend Quincey would say.
line = 4183 | 1 | All is best as they are." Dr. Seward seemed to answer them both in a
line = 4184 | 1 | dreamy kind of way:--
line = 4185 | 1 | 
line = 4186 | 1 | "I don't know but that I agree with you. If that man had been an
line = 4187 | 1 | ordinary lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him; but he
line = 4188 | 1 | seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am
line = 4189 | 1 | afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how
line = 4190 | 1 | he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat, and then tried to tear my
line = 4191 | 1 | throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and
line = 4192 | 1 | master,' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way.
line = 4193 | 1 | That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help
line = 4194 | 1 | him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He
line = 4195 | 1 | certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is
line = 4196 | 1 | best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand,
line = 4197 | 1 | help to unnerve a man." The Professor stepped over, and laying his hand
line = 4198 | 1 | on his shoulder, said in his grave, kindly way:--
line = 4199 | 1 | 
line = 4200 | 1 | "Friend John, have no fear. We are trying to do our duty in a very sad
line = 4201 | 1 | and terrible case; we can only do as we deem best. What else have we to
line = 4202 | 1 | hope for, except the pity of the good God?" Lord Godalming had slipped
line = 4203 | 1 | away for a few minutes, but now he returned. He held up a little silver
line = 4204 | 1 | whistle, as he remarked:--
line = 4205 | 1 | 
line = 4206 | 1 | "That old place may be full of rats, and if so, I've got an antidote on
line = 4207 | 1 | call." Having passed the wall, we took our way to the house, taking care
line = 4208 | 1 | to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone
line = 4209 | 1 | out. When we got to the porch the Professor opened his bag and took out
line = 4210 | 1 | a lot of things, which he laid on the step, sorting them into four
line = 4211 | 1 | little groups, evidently one for each. Then he spoke:--
line = 4212 | 1 | 
line = 4213 | 1 | "My friends, we are going into a terrible danger, and we need arms of
line = 4214 | 1 | many kinds. Our enemy is not merely spiritual. Remember that he has the
line = 4215 | 1 | strength of twenty men, and that, though our necks or our windpipes are
line = 4216 | 1 | of the common kind--and therefore breakable or crushable--his are not
line = 4217 | 1 | amenable to mere strength. A stronger man, or a body of men more strong
line = 4218 | 1 | in all than him, can at certain times hold him; but they cannot hurt him
line = 4219 | 1 | as we can be hurt by him. We must, therefore, guard ourselves from his
line = 4220 | 1 | touch. Keep this near your heart"--as he spoke he lifted a little silver
line = 4221 | 1 | crucifix and held it out to me, I being nearest to him--"put these
line = 4222 | 1 | flowers round your neck"--here he handed to me a wreath of withered
line = 4223 | 1 | garlic blossoms--"for other enemies more mundane, this revolver and this
line = 4224 | 1 | knife; and for aid in all, these so small electric lamps, which you can
line = 4225 | 1 | fasten to your breast; and for all, and above all at the last, this,
line = 4226 | 1 | which we must not desecrate needless." This was a portion of Sacred
line = 4227 | 1 | Wafer, which he put in an envelope and handed to me. Each of the others
line = 4228 | 1 | was similarly equipped. "Now," he said, "friend John, where are the
line = 4229 | 1 | skeleton keys? If so that we can open the door, we need not break house
line = 4230 | 1 | by the window, as before at Miss Lucy's."
line = 4231 | 1 | 
line = 4232 | 1 | Dr. Seward tried one or two skeleton keys, his mechanical dexterity as a
line = 4233 | 1 | surgeon standing him in good stead. Presently he got one to suit; after
line = 4234 | 1 | a little play back and forward the bolt yielded, and, with a rusty
line = 4235 | 1 | clang, shot back. We pressed on the door, the rusty hinges creaked, and
line = 4236 | 1 | it slowly opened. It was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in
line = 4237 | 1 | Dr. Seward's diary of the opening of Miss Westenra's tomb; I fancy that
line = 4238 | 1 | the same idea seemed to strike the others, for with one accord they
line = 4239 | 1 | shrank back. The Professor was the first to move forward, and stepped
line = 4240 | 1 | into the open door.
line = 4241 | 1 | 
line = 4242 | 1 | "_In manus tuas, Domine!_" he said, crossing himself as he passed over
line = 4243 | 1 | the threshold. We closed the door behind us, lest when we should have
line = 4244 | 1 | lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road. The
line = 4245 | 1 | Professor carefully tried the lock, lest we might not be able to open it
line = 4246 | 1 | from within should we be in a hurry making our exit. Then we all lit our
line = 4247 | 1 | lamps and proceeded on our search.
line = 4248 | 1 | 
line = 4249 | 1 | The light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms, as the
line = 4250 | 1 | rays crossed each other, or the opacity of our bodies threw great
line = 4251 | 1 | shadows. I could not for my life get away from the feeling that there
line = 4252 | 1 | was some one else amongst us. I suppose it was the recollection, so
line = 4253 | 1 | powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings, of that terrible
line = 4254 | 1 | experience in Transylvania. I think the feeling was common to us all,
line = 4255 | 1 | for I noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every
line = 4256 | 1 | sound and every new shadow, just as I felt myself doing.
line = 4257 | 1 | 
line = 4258 | 1 | The whole place was thick with dust. The floor was seemingly inches
line = 4259 | 1 | deep, except where there were recent footsteps, in which on holding down
line = 4260 | 1 | my lamp I could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked. The
line = 4261 | 1 | walls were fluffy and heavy with dust, and in the corners were masses of
line = 4262 | 1 | spider's webs, whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old
line = 4263 | 1 | tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down. On a table in the
line = 4264 | 1 | hall was a great bunch of keys, with a time-yellowed label on each. They
line = 4265 | 1 | had been used several times, for on the table were several similar rents
line = 4266 | 1 | in the blanket of dust, similar to that exposed when the Professor
line = 4267 | 1 | lifted them. He turned to me and said:--
line = 4268 | 1 | 
line = 4269 | 1 | "You know this place, Jonathan. You have copied maps of it, and you know
line = 4270 | 1 | it at least more than we do. Which is the way to the chapel?" I had an
line = 4271 | 1 | idea of its direction, though on my former visit I had not been able to
line = 4272 | 1 | get admission to it; so I led the way, and after a few wrong turnings
line = 4273 | 1 | found myself opposite a low, arched oaken door, ribbed with iron bands.
line = 4274 | 1 | "This is the spot," said the Professor as he turned his lamp on a small
line = 4275 | 1 | map of the house, copied from the file of my original correspondence
line = 4276 | 1 | regarding the purchase. With a little trouble we found the key on the
line = 4277 | 1 | bunch and opened the door. We were prepared for some unpleasantness, for
line = 4278 | 1 | as we were opening the door a faint, malodorous air seemed to exhale
line = 4279 | 1 | through the gaps, but none of us ever expected such an odour as we
line = 4280 | 1 | encountered. None of the others had met the Count at all at close
line = 4281 | 1 | quarters, and when I had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of
line = 4282 | 1 | his existence in his rooms or, when he was gloated with fresh blood, in
line = 4283 | 1 | a ruined building open to the air; but here the place was small and
line = 4284 | 1 | close, and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul. There was
line = 4285 | 1 | an earthy smell, as of some dry miasma, which came through the fouler
line = 4286 | 1 | air. But as to the odour itself, how shall I describe it? It was not
line = 4287 | 1 | alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the
line = 4288 | 1 | pungent, acrid smell of blood, but it seemed as though corruption had
line = 4289 | 1 | become itself corrupt. Faugh! it sickens me to think of it. Every breath
line = 4290 | 1 | exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and
line = 4291 | 1 | intensified its loathsomeness.
line = 4292 | 1 | 
line = 4293 | 1 | Under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our
line = 4294 | 1 | enterprise to an end; but this was no ordinary case, and the high and
line = 4295 | 1 | terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose
line = 4296 | 1 | above merely physical considerations. After the involuntary shrinking
line = 4297 | 1 | consequent on the first nauseous whiff, we one and all set about our
line = 4298 | 1 | work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses.
line = 4299 | 1 | 
line = 4300 | 1 | We made an accurate examination of the place, the Professor saying as we
line = 4301 | 1 | began:--
line = 4302 | 1 | 
line = 4303 | 1 | "The first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left; we must then
line = 4304 | 1 | examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some
line = 4305 | 1 | clue as to what has become of the rest." A glance was sufficient to show
line = 4306 | 1 | how many remained, for the great earth chests were bulky, and there was
line = 4307 | 1 | no mistaking them.
line = 4308 | 1 | 
line = 4309 | 1 | There were only twenty-nine left out of the fifty! Once I got a fright,
line = 4310 | 1 | for, seeing Lord Godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted
line = 4311 | 1 | door into the dark passage beyond, I looked too, and for an instant my
line = 4312 | 1 | heart stood still. Somewhere, looking out from the shadow, I seemed to
line = 4313 | 1 | see the high lights of the Count's evil face, the ridge of the nose, the
line = 4314 | 1 | red eyes, the red lips, the awful pallor. It was only for a moment, for,
line = 4315 | 1 | as Lord Godalming said, "I thought I saw a face, but it was only the
line = 4316 | 1 | shadows," and resumed his inquiry, I turned my lamp in the direction,
line = 4317 | 1 | and stepped into the passage. There was no sign of any one; and as there
line = 4318 | 1 | were no corners, no doors, no aperture of any kind, but only the solid
line = 4319 | 1 | walls of the passage, there could be no hiding-place even for _him_. I
line = 4320 | 1 | took it that fear had helped imagination, and said nothing.
line = 4321 | 1 | 
line = 4322 | 1 | A few minutes later I saw Morris step suddenly back from a corner, which
line = 4323 | 1 | he was examining. We all followed his movements with our eyes, for
line = 4324 | 1 | undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us, and we saw a whole mass
line = 4325 | 1 | of phosphorescence, which twinkled like stars. We all instinctively drew
line = 4326 | 1 | back. The whole place was becoming alive with rats.
line = 4327 | 1 | 
line = 4328 | 1 | For a moment or two we stood appalled, all save Lord Godalming, who was
line = 4329 | 1 | seemingly prepared for such an emergency. Rushing over to the great
line = 4330 | 1 | iron-bound oaken door, which Dr. Seward had described from the outside,
line = 4331 | 1 | and which I had seen myself, he turned the key in the lock, drew the
line = 4332 | 1 | huge bolts, and swung the door open. Then, taking his little silver
line = 4333 | 1 | whistle from his pocket, he blew a low, shrill call. It was answered
line = 4334 | 1 | from behind Dr. Seward's house by the yelping of dogs, and after about a
line = 4335 | 1 | minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house.
line = 4336 | 1 | Unconsciously we had all moved towards the door, and as we moved I
line = 4337 | 1 | noticed that the dust had been much disturbed: the boxes which had been
line = 4338 | 1 | taken out had been brought this way. But even in the minute that had
line = 4339 | 1 | elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased. They seemed to
line = 4340 | 1 | swarm over the place all at once, till the lamplight, shining on their
line = 4341 | 1 | moving dark bodies and glittering, baleful eyes, made the place look
line = 4342 | 1 | like a bank of earth set with fireflies. The dogs dashed on, but at the
line = 4343 | 1 | threshold suddenly stopped and snarled, and then, simultaneously lifting
line = 4344 | 1 | their noses, began to howl in most lugubrious fashion. The rats were
line = 4345 | 1 | multiplying in thousands, and we moved out.
line = 4346 | 1 | 
line = 4347 | 1 | Lord Godalming lifted one of the dogs, and carrying him in, placed him
line = 4348 | 1 | on the floor. The instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to
line = 4349 | 1 | recover his courage, and rushed at his natural enemies. They fled before
line = 4350 | 1 | him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other
line = 4351 | 1 | dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
line = 4352 | 1 | ere the whole mass had vanished.
line = 4353 | 1 | 
line = 4354 | 1 | With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
line = 4355 | 1 | the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
line = 4356 | 1 | their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
line = 4357 | 1 | the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.
line = 4358 | 1 | Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
line = 4359 | 1 | the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves
line = 4360 | 1 | in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to
line = 4361 | 1 | slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something
line = 4362 | 1 | of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our
line = 4363 | 1 | resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and
line = 4364 | 1 | bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found
line = 4365 | 1 | nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all
line = 4366 | 1 | untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.
line = 4367 | 1 | Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when
line = 4368 | 1 | we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been
line = 4369 | 1 | rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.
line = 4370 | 1 | 
line = 4371 | 1 | The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
line = 4372 | 1 | Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and
line = 4373 | 1 | locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
line = 4374 | 1 | when he had done.
line = 4375 | 1 | 
line = 4376 | 1 | "So far," he said, "our night has been eminently successful. No harm has
line = 4377 | 1 | come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how
line = 4378 | 1 | many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our
line = 4379 | 1 | first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been
line = 4380 | 1 | accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or
line = 4381 | 1 | troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
line = 4382 | 1 | smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have
line = 4383 | 1 | learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute
line = 4384 | 1 | beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable
line = 4385 | 1 | to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
line = 4386 | 1 | call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and
line = 4387 | 1 | to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell
line = 4388 | 1 | from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters
line = 4389 | 1 | before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used
line = 4390 | 1 | his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.
line = 4391 | 1 | So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity
line = 4392 | 1 | to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the
line = 4393 | 1 | stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,
line = 4394 | 1 | and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be
line = 4395 | 1 | ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;
line = 4396 | 1 | but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink."
line = 4397 | 1 | 
line = 4398 | 1 | The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
line = 4399 | 1 | was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound
line = 4400 | 1 | from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,
line = 4401 | 1 | after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.
line = 4402 | 1 | 
line = 4403 | 1 | I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so
line = 4404 | 1 | softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than
line = 4405 | 1 | usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly
line = 4406 | 1 | thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
line = 4407 | 1 | deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not
line = 4408 | 1 | think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is
line = 4409 | 1 | settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet
line = 4410 | 1 | to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she
line = 4411 | 1 | suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a
line = 4412 | 1 | sealed book to her, till at least such time as we can tell her that all
line = 4413 | 1 | is finished, and the earth free from a monster of the nether world. I
line = 4414 | 1 | daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such
line = 4415 | 1 | confidence as ours; but I must be resolute, and to-morrow I shall keep
line = 4416 | 1 | dark over to-night's doings, and shall refuse to speak of anything that
line = 4417 | 1 | has happened. I rest on the sofa, so as not to disturb her.
line = 4418 | 1 |

line = 4420 | 1 | 
line = 4421 | 1 | _1 October, later._--I suppose it was natural that we should have all
line = 4422 | 1 | overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no
line = 4423 | 1 | rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept
line = 4424 | 1 | till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or
line = 4425 | 1 | three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a
line = 4426 | 1 | few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of
line = 4427 | 1 | blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She
line = 4428 | 1 | complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the
line = 4429 | 1 | day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be
line = 4430 | 1 | that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace
line = 4431 | 1 | them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the
line = 4432 | 1 | sooner the matter is attended to the better. I shall look up Thomas
line = 4433 | 1 | Snelling to-day.
line = 4434 | 1 | 
line = 4435 | 1 | 
line = 4436 | 1 | _Dr. Seward's Diary._
line = 4437 | 1 | 
line = 4438 | 1 | _1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor
line = 4439 | 1 | walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
line = 4440 | 1 | is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the
line = 4441 | 1 | brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the
line = 4442 | 1 | night he suddenly said:--
line = 4443 | 1 | 
line = 4444 | 1 | "Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him
line = 4445 | 1 | this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may
line = 4446 | 1 | be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,
line = 4447 | 1 | and reason so sound." I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him
line = 4448 | 1 | that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to
line = 4449 | 1 | keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary
line = 4450 | 1 | instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against
line = 4451 | 1 | getting any false impression from my patient. "But," he answered, "I
line = 4452 | 1 | want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live
line = 4453 | 1 | things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that
line = 4454 | 1 | he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?"
line = 4455 | 1 | 
line = 4456 | 1 | "Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here." I laid my hand on the
line = 4457 | 1 | type-written matter. "When our sane and learned lunatic made that very
line = 4458 | 1 | statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually
line = 4459 | 1 | nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.
line = 4460 | 1 | Harker entered the room." Van Helsing smiled in turn. "Good!" he said.
line = 4461 | 1 | "Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it
line = 4462 | 1 | is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
line = 4463 | 1 | such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the
line = 4464 | 1 | folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.
line = 4465 | 1 | Who knows?" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in
line = 4466 | 1 | hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
line = 4467 | 1 | Van Helsing back in the study. "Do I interrupt?" he asked politely as he
line = 4468 | 1 | stood at the door.
line = 4469 | 1 | 
line = 4470 | 1 | "Not at all," I answered. "Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.
line = 4471 | 1 | I can go with you now, if you like.
line = 4472 | 1 | 
line = 4473 | 1 | "It is needless; I have seen him!"
line = 4474 | 1 | 
line = 4475 | 1 | "Well?"
line = 4476 | 1 | 
line = 4477 | 1 | "I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.
line = 4478 | 1 | When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with
line = 4479 | 1 | his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
line = 4480 | 1 | discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a
line = 4481 | 1 | measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. "Don't
line = 4482 | 1 | you know me?" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: "I know you well
line = 4483 | 1 | enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself
line = 4484 | 1 | and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed
line = 4485 | 1 | Dutchmen!" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable
line = 4486 | 1 | sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at
line = 4487 | 1 | all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so
line = 4488 | 1 | clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few
line = 4489 | 1 | happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does
line = 4490 | 1 | rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be
line = 4491 | 1 | worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it
line = 4492 | 1 | is better so."
line = 4493 | 1 | 
line = 4494 | 1 | "I agree with you with all my heart," I answered earnestly, for I did
line = 4495 | 1 | not want him to weaken in this matter. "Mrs. Harker is better out of it.
line = 4496 | 1 | Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
line = 4497 | 1 | been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,
line = 4498 | 1 | and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
line = 4499 | 1 | infallibly have wrecked her."
line = 4500 | 1 | 
line = 4501 | 1 | So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey
line = 4502 | 1 | and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I
line = 4503 | 1 | shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.

line = 4508 | 1 | _1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;
line = 4509 | 1 | after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him
line = 4510 | 1 | manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This
line = 4511 | 1 | morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
line = 4512 | 1 | Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went
line = 4513 | 1 | out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of
line = 4514 | 1 | what had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet he must
line = 4515 | 1 | have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it
line = 4516 | 1 | must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that
line = 4517 | 1 | it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and
line = 4518 | 1 | I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am
line = 4519 | 1 | crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great
line = 4520 | 1 | love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.
line = 4521 | 1 | 
line = 4522 | 1 | That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and
line = 4523 | 1 | lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept
line = 4524 | 1 | anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has
line = 4525 | 1 | feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my
line = 4526 | 1 | heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
line = 4527 | 1 | low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
line = 4528 | 1 | excitement.
line = 4529 | 1 | 
line = 4530 | 1 | Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
line = 4531 | 1 | me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I
line = 4532 | 1 | kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to
line = 4533 | 1 | see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate
line = 4534 | 1 | pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does
line = 4535 | 1 | seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which
line = 4536 | 1 | is most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear
line = 4537 | 1 | Lucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard
line = 4538 | 1 | till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me she
line = 4539 | 1 | wouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at
line = 4540 | 1 | night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.
line = 4541 | 1 | Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what
line = 4542 | 1 | has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew
line = 4543 | 1 | that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my
line = 4544 | 1 | own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear
line = 4545 | 1 | fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do
line = 4546 | 1 | feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons
line = 4547 | 1 | that we poor women have to learn....
line = 4548 | 1 | 
line = 4549 | 1 | I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing
line = 4550 | 1 | the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying
line = 4551 | 1 | on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere
line = 4552 | 1 | under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so
line = 4553 | 1 | profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.
line = 4554 | 1 | All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight
line = 4555 | 1 | seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be
line = 4556 | 1 | stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin
line = 4557 | 1 | streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness
line = 4558 | 1 | across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a
line = 4559 | 1 | vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must
line = 4560 | 1 | have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy
line = 4561 | 1 | creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out
line = 4562 | 1 | and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now
line = 4563 | 1 | close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the
line = 4564 | 1 | wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was
line = 4565 | 1 | more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,
line = 4566 | 1 | I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
line = 4567 | 1 | his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the
line = 4568 | 1 | attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into
line = 4569 | 1 | bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
line = 4570 | 1 | I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have
line = 4571 | 1 | fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the
line = 4572 | 1 | morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a
line = 4573 | 1 | little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was
line = 4574 | 1 | bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of
line = 4575 | 1 | the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.
line = 4576 | 1 | 
line = 4577 | 1 | I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I
line = 4578 | 1 | was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my
line = 4579 | 1 | hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
line = 4580 | 1 | usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn
line = 4581 | 1 | upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the
line = 4582 | 1 | clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
line = 4583 | 1 | around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,
line = 4584 | 1 | came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently
line = 4585 | 1 | grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I
line = 4586 | 1 | had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to
line = 4587 | 1 | make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my
line = 4588 | 1 | limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed
line = 4589 | 1 | my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what
line = 4590 | 1 | tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The
line = 4591 | 1 | mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I
line = 4592 | 1 | could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling
line = 4593 | 1 | water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of
line = 4594 | 1 | the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became
line = 4595 | 1 | concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
line = 4596 | 1 | of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things
line = 4597 | 1 | began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now
line = 4598 | 1 | whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words "a
line = 4599 | 1 | pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night." Was it indeed some such
line = 4600 | 1 | spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was
line = 4601 | 1 | composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the
line = 4602 | 1 | red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I
line = 4603 | 1 | looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like
line = 4604 | 1 | two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering
line = 4605 | 1 | when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's
line = 4606 | 1 | Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan
line = 4607 | 1 | had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist
line = 4608 | 1 | in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became
line = 4609 | 1 | black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to
line = 4610 | 1 | show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be
line = 4611 | 1 | careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were
line = 4612 | 1 | too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe
line = 4613 | 1 | something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm
line = 4614 | 1 | them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their
line = 4615 | 1 | fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do
line = 4616 | 1 | not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that
line = 4617 | 1 | cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last
line = 4618 | 1 | night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.

line = 4622 | 1 | _2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have
line = 4623 | 1 | slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the
line = 4624 | 1 | sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and
line = 4625 | 1 | spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
line = 4626 | 1 | In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was
line = 4627 | 1 | very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless
line = 4628 | 1 | me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This
line = 4629 | 1 | is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be
line = 4630 | 1 | miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till
line = 4631 | 1 | dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten
line = 4632 | 1 | them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how
line = 4633 | 1 | tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke
line = 4634 | 1 | together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other
line = 4635 | 1 | of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan's
line = 4636 | 1 | manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so
line = 4637 | 1 | sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to
line = 4638 | 1 | give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night
line = 4639 | 1 | before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to
line = 4640 | 1 | me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I
line = 4641 | 1 | have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope
line = 4642 | 1 | I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear
line = 4643 | 1 | comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the
line = 4644 | 1 | power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.

line = 4653 | 1 | 
line = 4654 | 1 | _1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal
line = 4655 | 1 | Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The
line = 4656 | 1 | very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had
line = 4657 | 1 | proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I
line = 4658 | 1 | learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he
line = 4659 | 1 | was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the
line = 4660 | 1 | responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph
line = 4661 | 1 | Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a
line = 4662 | 1 | saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable
line = 4663 | 1 | type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all
line = 4664 | 1 | about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared
line = 4665 | 1 | notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
line = 4666 | 1 | seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
line = 4667 | 1 | half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There
line = 4668 | 1 | were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at
line = 4669 | 1 | 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he
line = 4670 | 1 | deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to
line = 4671 | 1 | scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were
line = 4672 | 1 | chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more
line = 4673 | 1 | fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that
line = 4674 | 1 | he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now
line = 4675 | 1 | fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern
line = 4676 | 1 | shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to
line = 4677 | 1 | be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the
line = 4678 | 1 | very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back
line = 4679 | 1 | to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had
line = 4680 | 1 | been taken from Carfax.
line = 4681 | 1 | 
line = 4682 | 1 | He replied:--
line = 4683 | 1 | 
line = 4684 | 1 | "Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some"--I had given him half a
line = 4685 | 1 | sovereign--"an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of
line = 4686 | 1 | Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley,
line = 4687 | 1 | as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at
line = 4688 | 1 | Purfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'
line = 4689 | 1 | that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut." I asked if he could tell me
line = 4690 | 1 | where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it
line = 4691 | 1 | would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest
line = 4692 | 1 | of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search
line = 4693 | 1 | then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--
line = 4694 | 1 | 
line = 4695 | 1 | "Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere. I
line = 4696 | 1 | may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way
line = 4697 | 1 | to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.
line = 4698 | 1 | If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on
line = 4699 | 1 | it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But
line = 4700 | 1 | ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch
line = 4701 | 1 | 'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore."
line = 4702 | 1 | 
line = 4703 | 1 | This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to
line = 4704 | 1 | buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she
line = 4705 | 1 | came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had
line = 4706 | 1 | again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way
line = 4707 | 1 | to home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.
line = 4708 | 1 | Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as
line = 4709 | 1 | though she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be
line = 4710 | 1 | kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the
line = 4711 | 1 | others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and
line = 4712 | 1 | worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors
line = 4713 | 1 | were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
line = 4714 | 1 | business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence
line = 4715 | 1 | must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any
line = 4716 | 1 | circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she
line = 4717 | 1 | herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the
line = 4718 | 1 | Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.

line = 4722 | 1 | _2 October, evening._--A long and trying and exciting day. By the first
line = 4723 | 1 | post I got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed, on
line = 4724 | 1 | which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hand:--
line = 4725 | 1 | 
line = 4726 | 1 | "Sam Bloxam, Korkrans, 4, Poters Cort, Bartel Street, Walworth. Arsk for
line = 4727 | 1 | the depite."
line = 4728 | 1 | 
line = 4729 | 1 | I got the letter in bed, and rose without waking Mina. She looked heavy
line = 4730 | 1 | and sleepy and pale, and far from well. I determined not to wake her,
line = 4731 | 1 | but that, when I should return from this new search, I would arrange for
line = 4732 | 1 | her going back to Exeter. I think she would be happier in our own home,
line = 4733 | 1 | with her daily tasks to interest her, than in being here amongst us and
line = 4734 | 1 | in ignorance. I only saw Dr. Seward for a moment, and told him where I
line = 4735 | 1 | was off to, promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as I should
line = 4736 | 1 | have found out anything. I drove to Walworth and found, with some
line = 4737 | 1 | difficulty, Potter's Court. Mr. Smollet's spelling misled me, as I asked
line = 4738 | 1 | for Poter's Court instead of Potter's Court. However, when I had found
line = 4739 | 1 | the court, I had no difficulty in discovering Corcoran's lodging-house.
line = 4740 | 1 | When I asked the man who came to the door for the "depite," he shook his
line = 4741 | 1 | head, and said: "I dunno 'im. There ain't no such a person 'ere; I never
line = 4742 | 1 | 'eard of 'im in all my bloomin' days. Don't believe there ain't nobody
line = 4743 | 1 | of that kind livin' ere or anywheres." I took out Smollet's letter, and
line = 4744 | 1 | as I read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name
line = 4745 | 1 | of the court might guide me. "What are you?" I asked.
line = 4746 | 1 | 
line = 4747 | 1 | "I'm the depity," he answered. I saw at once that I was on the right
line = 4748 | 1 | track; phonetic spelling had again misled me. A half-crown tip put the
line = 4749 | 1 | deputy's knowledge at my disposal, and I learned that Mr. Bloxam, who
line = 4750 | 1 | had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at
line = 4751 | 1 | Corcoran's, had left for his work at Poplar at five o'clock that
line = 4752 | 1 | morning. He could not tell me where the place of work was situated, but
line = 4753 | 1 | he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a "new-fangled ware'us";
line = 4754 | 1 | and with this slender clue I had to start for Poplar. It was twelve
line = 4755 | 1 | o'clock before I got any satisfactory hint of such a building, and this
line = 4756 | 1 | I got at a coffee-shop, where some workmen were having their dinner. One
line = 4757 | 1 | of these suggested that there was being erected at Cross Angel Street a
line = 4758 | 1 | new "cold storage" building; and as this suited the condition of a
line = 4759 | 1 | "new-fangled ware'us," I at once drove to it. An interview with a surly
line = 4760 | 1 | gatekeeper and a surlier foreman, both of whom were appeased with the
line = 4761 | 1 | coin of the realm, put me on the track of Bloxam; he was sent for on my
line = 4762 | 1 | suggesting that I was willing to pay his day's wages to his foreman for
line = 4763 | 1 | the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter. He was
line = 4764 | 1 | a smart enough fellow, though rough of speech and bearing. When I had
line = 4765 | 1 | promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest, he told me
line = 4766 | 1 | that he had made two journeys between Carfax and a house in Piccadilly,
line = 4767 | 1 | and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes--"main
line = 4768 | 1 | heavy ones"--with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose. I
line = 4769 | 1 | asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in Piccadilly, to
line = 4770 | 1 | which he replied:--
line = 4771 | 1 | 
line = 4772 | 1 | "Well, guv'nor, I forgits the number, but it was only a few doors from a
line = 4773 | 1 | big white church or somethink of the kind, not long built. It was a
line = 4774 | 1 | dusty old 'ouse, too, though nothin' to the dustiness of the 'ouse we
line = 4775 | 1 | tooked the bloomin' boxes from."
line = 4776 | 1 | 
line = 4777 | 1 | "How did you get into the houses if they were both empty?"
line = 4778 | 1 | 
line = 4779 | 1 | "There was the old party what engaged me a-waitin' in the 'ouse at
line = 4780 | 1 | Purfleet. He 'elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray. Curse
line = 4781 | 1 | me, but he was the strongest chap I ever struck, an' him a old feller,
line = 4782 | 1 | with a white moustache, one that thin you would think he couldn't throw
line = 4783 | 1 | a shadder."
line = 4784 | 1 | 
line = 4785 | 1 | How this phrase thrilled through me!
line = 4786 | 1 | 
line = 4787 | 1 | "Why, 'e took up 'is end o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea, and
line = 4788 | 1 | me a-puffin' an' a-blowin' afore I could up-end mine anyhow--an' I'm no
line = 4789 | 1 | chicken, neither."
line = 4790 | 1 | 
line = 4791 | 1 | "How did you get into the house in Piccadilly?" I asked.
line = 4792 | 1 | 
line = 4793 | 1 | "He was there too. He must 'a' started off and got there afore me, for
line = 4794 | 1 | when I rung of the bell he kem an' opened the door 'isself an' 'elped me
line = 4795 | 1 | to carry the boxes into the 'all."
line = 4796 | 1 | 
line = 4797 | 1 | "The whole nine?" I asked.
line = 4798 | 1 | 
line = 4799 | 1 | "Yus; there was five in the first load an' four in the second. It was
line = 4800 | 1 | main dry work, an' I don't so well remember 'ow I got 'ome." I
line = 4801 | 1 | interrupted him:--
line = 4802 | 1 | 
line = 4803 | 1 | "Were the boxes left in the hall?"
line = 4804 | 1 | 
line = 4805 | 1 | "Yus; it was a big 'all, an' there was nothin' else in it." I made one
line = 4806 | 1 | more attempt to further matters:--
line = 4807 | 1 | 
line = 4808 | 1 | "You didn't have any key?"
line = 4809 | 1 | 
line = 4810 | 1 | "Never used no key nor nothink. The old gent, he opened the door 'isself
line = 4811 | 1 | an' shut it again when I druv off. I don't remember the last time--but
line = 4812 | 1 | that was the beer."
line = 4813 | 1 | 
line = 4814 | 1 | "And you can't remember the number of the house?"
line = 4815 | 1 | 
line = 4816 | 1 | "No, sir. But ye needn't have no difficulty about that. It's a 'igh 'un
line = 4817 | 1 | with a stone front with a bow on it, an' 'igh steps up to the door. I
line = 4818 | 1 | know them steps, 'avin' 'ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers
line = 4819 | 1 | what come round to earn a copper. The old gent give them shillin's, an'
line = 4820 | 1 | they seein' they got so much, they wanted more; but 'e took one of them
line = 4821 | 1 | by the shoulder and was like to throw 'im down the steps, till the lot
line = 4822 | 1 | of them went away cussin'." I thought that with this description I could
line = 4823 | 1 | find the house, so, having paid my friend for his information, I started
line = 4824 | 1 | off for Piccadilly. I had gained a new painful experience; the Count
line = 4825 | 1 | could, it was evident, handle the earth-boxes himself. If so, time was
line = 4826 | 1 | precious; for, now that he had achieved a certain amount of
line = 4827 | 1 | distribution, he could, by choosing his own time, complete the task
line = 4828 | 1 | unobserved. At Piccadilly Circus I discharged my cab, and walked
line = 4829 | 1 | westward; beyond the Junior Constitutional I came across the house
line = 4830 | 1 | described, and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs
line = 4831 | 1 | arranged by Dracula. The house looked as though it had been long
line = 4832 | 1 | untenanted. The windows were encrusted with dust, and the shutters were
line = 4833 | 1 | up. All the framework was black with time, and from the iron the paint
line = 4834 | 1 | had mostly scaled away. It was evident that up to lately there had been
line = 4835 | 1 | a large notice-board in front of the balcony; it had, however, been
line = 4836 | 1 | roughly torn away, the uprights which had supported it still remaining.
line = 4837 | 1 | Behind the rails of the balcony I saw there were some loose boards,
line = 4838 | 1 | whose raw edges looked white. I would have given a good deal to have
line = 4839 | 1 | been able to see the notice-board intact, as it would, perhaps, have
line = 4840 | 1 | given some clue to the ownership of the house. I remembered my
line = 4841 | 1 | experience of the investigation and purchase of Carfax, and I could not
line = 4842 | 1 | but feel that if I could find the former owner there might be some means
line = 4843 | 1 | discovered of gaining access to the house.
line = 4844 | 1 | 
line = 4845 | 1 | There was at present nothing to be learned from the Piccadilly side, and
line = 4846 | 1 | nothing could be done; so I went round to the back to see if anything
line = 4847 | 1 | could be gathered from this quarter. The mews were active, the
line = 4848 | 1 | Piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation. I asked one or two of the
line = 4849 | 1 | grooms and helpers whom I saw around if they could tell me anything
line = 4850 | 1 | about the empty house. One of them said that he heard it had lately been
line = 4851 | 1 | taken, but he couldn't say from whom. He told me, however, that up to
line = 4852 | 1 | very lately there had been a notice-board of "For Sale" up, and that
line = 4853 | 1 | perhaps Mitchell, Sons, & Candy, the house agents, could tell me
line = 4854 | 1 | something, as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on
line = 4855 | 1 | the board. I did not wish to seem too eager, or to let my informant know
line = 4856 | 1 | or guess too much, so, thanking him in the usual manner, I strolled
line = 4857 | 1 | away. It was now growing dusk, and the autumn night was closing in, so I
line = 4858 | 1 | did not lose any time. Having learned the address of Mitchell, Sons, &
line = 4859 | 1 | Candy from a directory at the Berkeley, I was soon at their office in
line = 4860 | 1 | Sackville Street.
line = 4861 | 1 | 
line = 4862 | 1 | The gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner, but
line = 4863 | 1 | uncommunicative in equal proportion. Having once told me that the
line = 4864 | 1 | Piccadilly house--which throughout our interview he called a
line = 4865 | 1 | "mansion"--was sold, he considered my business as concluded. When I
line = 4866 | 1 | asked who had purchased it, he opened his eyes a thought wider, and
line = 4867 | 1 | paused a few seconds before replying:--
line = 4868 | 1 | 
line = 4869 | 1 | "It is sold, sir."
line = 4870 | 1 | 
line = 4871 | 1 | "Pardon me," I said, with equal politeness, "but I have a special reason
line = 4872 | 1 | for wishing to know who purchased it."
line = 4873 | 1 | 
line = 4874 | 1 | Again he paused longer, and raised his eyebrows still more. "It is sold,
line = 4875 | 1 | sir," was again his laconic reply.
line = 4876 | 1 | 
line = 4877 | 1 | "Surely," I said, "you do not mind letting me know so much."
line = 4878 | 1 | 
line = 4879 | 1 | "But I do mind," he answered. "The affairs of their clients are
line = 4880 | 1 | absolutely safe in the hands of Mitchell, Sons, & Candy." This was
line = 4881 | 1 | manifestly a prig of the first water, and there was no use arguing with
line = 4882 | 1 | him. I thought I had best meet him on his own ground, so I said:--
line = 4883 | 1 | 
line = 4884 | 1 | "Your clients, sir, are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their
line = 4885 | 1 | confidence. I am myself a professional man." Here I handed him my card.
line = 4886 | 1 | "In this instance I am not prompted by curiosity; I act on the part of
line = 4887 | 1 | Lord Godalming, who wishes to know something of the property which was,
line = 4888 | 1 | he understood, lately for sale." These words put a different complexion
line = 4889 | 1 | on affairs. He said:--
line = 4890 | 1 | 
line = 4891 | 1 | "I would like to oblige you if I could, Mr. Harker, and especially would
line = 4892 | 1 | I like to oblige his lordship. We once carried out a small matter of
line = 4893 | 1 | renting some chambers for him when he was the Honourable Arthur
line = 4894 | 1 | Holmwood. If you will let me have his lordship's address I will consult
line = 4895 | 1 | the House on the subject, and will, in any case, communicate with his
line = 4896 | 1 | lordship by to-night's post. It will be a pleasure if we can so far
line = 4897 | 1 | deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his
line = 4898 | 1 | lordship."
line = 4899 | 1 | 
line = 4900 | 1 | I wanted to secure a friend, and not to make an enemy, so I thanked him,
line = 4901 | 1 | gave the address at Dr. Seward's and came away. It was now dark, and I
line = 4902 | 1 | was tired and hungry. I got a cup of tea at the Aërated Bread Company
line = 4903 | 1 | and came down to Purfleet by the next train.
line = 4904 | 1 | 
line = 4905 | 1 | I found all the others at home. Mina was looking tired and pale, but she
line = 4906 | 1 | made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful, it wrung my heart to
line = 4907 | 1 | think that I had had to keep anything from her and so caused her
line = 4908 | 1 | inquietude. Thank God, this will be the last night of her looking on at
line = 4909 | 1 | our conferences, and feeling the sting of our not showing our
line = 4910 | 1 | confidence. It took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of
line = 4911 | 1 | keeping her out of our grim task. She seems somehow more reconciled; or
line = 4912 | 1 | else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her, for when
line = 4913 | 1 | any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders. I am glad we
line = 4914 | 1 | made our resolution in time, as with such a feeling as this, our growing
line = 4915 | 1 | knowledge would be torture to her.
line = 4916 | 1 | 
line = 4917 | 1 | I could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone;
line = 4918 | 1 | so after dinner--followed by a little music to save appearances even
line = 4919 | 1 | amongst ourselves--I took Mina to her room and left her to go to bed.
line = 4920 | 1 | The dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever, and clung to me
line = 4921 | 1 | as though she would detain me; but there was much to be talked of and I
line = 4922 | 1 | came away. Thank God, the ceasing of telling things has made no
line = 4923 | 1 | difference between us.
line = 4924 | 1 | 
line = 4925 | 1 | When I came down again I found the others all gathered round the fire in
line = 4926 | 1 | the study. In the train I had written my diary so far, and simply read
line = 4927 | 1 | it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own
line = 4928 | 1 | information; when I had finished Van Helsing said:--
line = 4929 | 1 | 
line = 4930 | 1 | "This has been a great day's work, friend Jonathan. Doubtless we are on
line = 4931 | 1 | the track of the missing boxes. If we find them all in that house, then
line = 4932 | 1 | our work is near the end. But if there be some missing, we must search
line = 4933 | 1 | until we find them. Then shall we make our final _coup_, and hunt the
line = 4934 | 1 | wretch to his real death." We all sat silent awhile and all at once Mr.
line = 4935 | 1 | Morris spoke:--
line = 4936 | 1 | 
line = 4937 | 1 | "Say! how are we going to get into that house?"
line = 4938 | 1 | 
line = 4939 | 1 | "We got into the other," answered Lord Godalming quickly.
line = 4940 | 1 | 
line = 4941 | 1 | "But, Art, this is different. We broke house at Carfax, but we had night
line = 4942 | 1 | and a walled park to protect us. It will be a mighty different thing to
line = 4943 | 1 | commit burglary in Piccadilly, either by day or night. I confess I don't
line = 4944 | 1 | see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key
line = 4945 | 1 | of some sort; perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the
line = 4946 | 1 | morning." Lord Godalming's brows contracted, and he stood up and walked
line = 4947 | 1 | about the room. By-and-by he stopped and said, turning from one to
line = 4948 | 1 | another of us:--
line = 4949 | 1 | 
line = 4950 | 1 | "Quincey's head is level. This burglary business is getting serious; we
line = 4951 | 1 | got off once all right; but we have now a rare job on hand--unless we
line = 4952 | 1 | can find the Count's key basket."
line = 4953 | 1 | 
line = 4954 | 1 | As nothing could well be done before morning, and as it would be at
line = 4955 | 1 | least advisable to wait till Lord Godalming should hear from Mitchell's,
line = 4956 | 1 | we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time. For a good
line = 4957 | 1 | while we sat and smoked, discussing the matter in its various lights and
line = 4958 | 1 | bearings; I took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the
line = 4959 | 1 | moment. I am very sleepy and shall go to bed....
line = 4960 | 1 | 
line = 4961 | 1 | Just a line. Mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular. Her
line = 4962 | 1 | forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles, as though she thinks even
line = 4963 | 1 | in her sleep. She is still too pale, but does not look so haggard as she
line = 4964 | 1 | did this morning. To-morrow will, I hope, mend all this; she will be
line = 4965 | 1 | herself at home in Exeter. Oh, but I am sleepy!
line = 4966 | 1 | 
line = 4967 | 1 | 
line = 4968 | 1 | _Dr. Seward's Diary._
line = 4969 | 1 | 
line = 4970 | 1 | _1 October._--I am puzzled afresh about Renfield. His moods change so
line = 4971 | 1 | rapidly that I find it difficult to keep touch of them, and as they
line = 4972 | 1 | always mean something more than his own well-being, they form a more
line = 4973 | 1 | than interesting study. This morning, when I went to see him after his
line = 4974 | 1 | repulse of Van Helsing, his manner was that of a man commanding destiny.
line = 4975 | 1 | He was, in fact, commanding destiny--subjectively. He did not really
line = 4976 | 1 | care for any of the things of mere earth; he was in the clouds and
line = 4977 | 1 | looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals. I
line = 4978 | 1 | thought I would improve the occasion and learn something, so I asked
line = 4979 | 1 | him:--
line = 4980 | 1 | 
line = 4981 | 1 | "What about the flies these times?" He smiled on me in quite a superior
line = 4982 | 1 | sort of way--such a smile as would have become the face of Malvolio--as
line = 4983 | 1 | he answered me:--
line = 4984 | 1 | 
line = 4985 | 1 | "The fly, my dear sir, has one striking feature; its wings are typical
line = 4986 | 1 | of the aërial powers of the psychic faculties. The ancients did well
line = 4987 | 1 | when they typified the soul as a butterfly!"
line = 4988 | 1 | 
line = 4989 | 1 | I thought I would push his analogy to its utmost logically, so I said
line = 4990 | 1 | quickly:--
line = 4991 | 1 | 
line = 4992 | 1 | "Oh, it is a soul you are after now, is it?" His madness foiled his
line = 4993 | 1 | reason, and a puzzled look spread over his face as, shaking his head
line = 4994 | 1 | with a decision which I had but seldom seen in him, he said:--
line = 4995 | 1 | 
line = 4996 | 1 | "Oh, no, oh no! I want no souls. Life is all I want." Here he brightened
line = 4997 | 1 | up; "I am pretty indifferent about it at present. Life is all right; I
line = 4998 | 1 | have all I want. You must get a new patient, doctor, if you wish to
line = 4999 | 1 | study zoöphagy!"
line = 5000 | 1 | 
line = 5001 | 1 | This puzzled me a little, so I drew him on:--
line = 5002 | 1 | 
line = 5003 | 1 | "Then you command life; you are a god, I suppose?" He smiled with an
line = 5004 | 1 | ineffably benign superiority.
line = 5005 | 1 | 
line = 5006 | 1 | "Oh no! Far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the
line = 5007 | 1 | Deity. I am not even concerned in His especially spiritual doings. If I
line = 5008 | 1 | may state my intellectual position I am, so far as concerns things
line = 5009 | 1 | purely terrestrial, somewhat in the position which Enoch occupied
line = 5010 | 1 | spiritually!" This was a poser to me. I could not at the moment recall
line = 5011 | 1 | Enoch's appositeness; so I had to ask a simple question, though I felt
line = 5012 | 1 | that by so doing I was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic:--
line = 5013 | 1 | 
line = 5014 | 1 | "And why with Enoch?"
