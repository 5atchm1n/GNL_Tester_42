line = 65 | 1 | I had for breakfast more paprika, and a sort of porridge of maize flour

line = 73 | 1 | 
line = 74 | 1 | All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of
line = 75 | 1 | beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the

line = 77 | 1 | rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
line = 78 | 1 | of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
line = 79 | 1 | running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear. At every
line = 80 | 1 | station there were groups of people, sometimes crowds, and in all sorts
line = 81 | 1 | of attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I
line = 82 | 1 | saw coming through France and Germany, with short jackets and round hats
line = 83 | 1 | and home-made trousers; but others were very picturesque. The women
line = 84 | 1 | looked pretty, except when you got near them, but they were very clumsy
line = 85 | 1 | about the waist. They had all full white sleeves of some kind or other,
line = 86 | 1 | and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
line = 87 | 1 | fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet, but of course there
line = 88 | 1 | were petticoats under them. The strangest figures we saw were the
line = 89 | 1 | Slovaks, who were more barbarian than the rest, with their big cow-boy
line = 90 | 1 | hats, great baggy dirty-white trousers, white linen shirts, and enormous
line = 91 | 1 | heavy leather belts, nearly a foot wide, all studded over with brass
line = 92 | 1 | nails. They wore high boots, with their trousers tucked into them, and
line = 93 | 1 | had long black hair and heavy black moustaches. They are very
line = 94 | 1 | picturesque, but do not look prepossessing. On the stage they would be
line = 95 | 1 | set down at once as some old Oriental band of brigands. They are,

line = 98 | 1 | 
line = 99 | 1 | It was on the dark side of twilight when we got to Bistritz, which is a
line = 100 | 1 | very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
line = 101 | 1 | Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
line = 102 | 1 | existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
line = 103 | 1 | of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
line = 104 | 1 | occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
line = 105 | 1 | a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
line = 106 | 1 | proper being assisted by famine and disease.
line = 107 | 1 | 
line = 108 | 1 | Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
line = 109 | 1 | found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
line = 110 | 1 | course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
line = 111 | 1 | evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
line = 112 | 1 | cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
line = 113 | 1 | undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
line = 114 | 1 | fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
line = 115 | 1 | said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She
line = 116 | 1 | smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
line = 117 | 1 | who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
line = 118 | 1 | a letter:--
line = 119 | 1 | 
line = 120 | 1 |      "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
line = 121 | 1 |      you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
line = 122 | 1 |      start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
line = 123 | 1 |      Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
line = 124 | 1 |      that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
line = 125 | 1 |      will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.

line = 132 | 1 | _4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
line = 133 | 1 | directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
line = 134 | 1 | making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
line = 135 | 1 | pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
line = 136 | 1 | true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
line = 137 | 1 | answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
line = 138 | 1 | lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
line = 139 | 1 | way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
line = 140 | 1 | was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
line = 141 | 1 | tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
line = 142 | 1 | and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
line = 143 | 1 | further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
line = 144 | 1 | any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
line = 145 | 1 | comforting.
line = 146 | 1 | 
line = 147 | 1 | Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
line = 148 | 1 | very hysterical way:
line = 149 | 1 | 
line = 150 | 1 | "Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited
line = 151 | 1 | state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
line = 152 | 1 | mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
line = 153 | 1 | was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
line = 154 | 1 | that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
line = 155 | 1 | she asked again:
line = 156 | 1 | 
line = 157 | 1 | "Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May.
line = 158 | 1 | She shook her head as she said again:
line = 159 | 1 | 
line = 160 | 1 | "Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On
line = 161 | 1 | my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
line = 162 | 1 | 
line = 163 | 1 | "It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
line = 164 | 1 | the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
line = 165 | 1 | full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"
line = 166 | 1 | She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
line = 167 | 1 | without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
line = 168 | 1 | to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
line = 169 | 1 | ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
line = 170 | 1 | to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
line = 171 | 1 | tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
line = 172 | 1 | her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
line = 173 | 1 | dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
line = 174 | 1 | did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
line = 175 | 1 | taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
line = 176 | 1 | seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
line = 177 | 1 | state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
line = 178 | 1 | rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out
line = 179 | 1 | of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
line = 180 | 1 | for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
line = 181 | 1 | round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
line = 182 | 1 | traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
line = 183 | 1 | am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
line = 184 | 1 | ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
line = 185 | 1 | coach!

line = 100 | 1 | very interesting old place. Being practically on the frontier--for the
line = 101 | 1 | Borgo Pass leads from it into Bukovina--it has had a very stormy
line = 102 | 1 | existence, and it certainly shows marks of it. Fifty years ago a series
line = 103 | 1 | of great fires took place, which made terrible havoc on five separate
line = 104 | 1 | occasions. At the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent
line = 105 | 1 | a siege of three weeks and lost 13,000 people, the casualties of war
line = 106 | 1 | proper being assisted by famine and disease.
line = 107 | 1 | 
line = 108 | 1 | Count Dracula had directed me to go to the Golden Krone Hotel, which I
line = 109 | 1 | found, to my great delight, to be thoroughly old-fashioned, for of
line = 110 | 1 | course I wanted to see all I could of the ways of the country. I was
line = 111 | 1 | evidently expected, for when I got near the door I faced a
line = 112 | 1 | cheery-looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress--white
line = 113 | 1 | undergarment with long double apron, front, and back, of coloured stuff
line = 114 | 1 | fitting almost too tight for modesty. When I came close she bowed and
line = 115 | 1 | said, "The Herr Englishman?" "Yes," I said, "Jonathan Harker." She
line = 116 | 1 | smiled, and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt-sleeves,
line = 117 | 1 | who had followed her to the door. He went, but immediately returned with
line = 118 | 1 | a letter:--
line = 119 | 1 | 
line = 120 | 1 |      "My Friend.--Welcome to the Carpathians. I am anxiously expecting
line = 121 | 1 |      you. Sleep well to-night. At three to-morrow the diligence will
line = 122 | 1 |      start for Bukovina; a place on it is kept for you. At the Borgo
line = 123 | 1 |      Pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me. I trust
line = 124 | 1 |      that your journey from London has been a happy one, and that you
line = 125 | 1 |      will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land.
line = 126 | 1 | 
line = 127 | 1 | "Your friend,
line = 128 | 1 | 
line = 129 | 1 | "DRACULA."
line = 130 | 1 | 
line = 131 | 1 | 
line = 132 | 1 | _4 May._--I found that my landlord had got a letter from the Count,
line = 133 | 1 | directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me; but on
line = 134 | 1 | making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent, and
line = 135 | 1 | pretended that he could not understand my German. This could not be
line = 136 | 1 | true, because up to then he had understood it perfectly; at least, he
line = 137 | 1 | answered my questions exactly as if he did. He and his wife, the old
line = 138 | 1 | lady who had received me, looked at each other in a frightened sort of
line = 139 | 1 | way. He mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter, and that
line = 140 | 1 | was all he knew. When I asked him if he knew Count Dracula, and could
line = 141 | 1 | tell me anything of his castle, both he and his wife crossed themselves,
line = 142 | 1 | and, saying that they knew nothing at all, simply refused to speak
line = 143 | 1 | further. It was so near the time of starting that I had no time to ask
line = 144 | 1 | any one else, for it was all very mysterious and not by any means
line = 145 | 1 | comforting.
line = 146 | 1 | 
line = 147 | 1 | Just before I was leaving, the old lady came up to my room and said in a
line = 148 | 1 | very hysterical way:
line = 149 | 1 | 
line = 150 | 1 | "Must you go? Oh! young Herr, must you go?" She was in such an excited
line = 151 | 1 | state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what German she knew, and
line = 152 | 1 | mixed it all up with some other language which I did not know at all. I
line = 153 | 1 | was just able to follow her by asking many questions. When I told her
line = 154 | 1 | that I must go at once, and that I was engaged on important business,
line = 155 | 1 | she asked again:
line = 156 | 1 | 
line = 157 | 1 | "Do you know what day it is?" I answered that it was the fourth of May.
line = 158 | 1 | She shook her head as she said again:
line = 159 | 1 | 
line = 160 | 1 | "Oh, yes! I know that! I know that, but do you know what day it is?" On
line = 161 | 1 | my saying that I did not understand, she went on:
line = 162 | 1 | 
line = 163 | 1 | "It is the eve of St. George's Day. Do you not know that to-night, when
line = 164 | 1 | the clock strikes midnight, all the evil things in the world will have
line = 165 | 1 | full sway? Do you know where you are going, and what you are going to?"
line = 166 | 1 | She was in such evident distress that I tried to comfort her, but
line = 167 | 1 | without effect. Finally she went down on her knees and implored me not
line = 168 | 1 | to go; at least to wait a day or two before starting. It was all very
line = 169 | 1 | ridiculous but I did not feel comfortable. However, there was business
line = 170 | 1 | to be done, and I could allow nothing to interfere with it. I therefore
line = 171 | 1 | tried to raise her up, and said, as gravely as I could, that I thanked
line = 172 | 1 | her, but my duty was imperative, and that I must go. She then rose and
line = 173 | 1 | dried her eyes, and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me. I
line = 174 | 1 | did not know what to do, for, as an English Churchman, I have been
line = 175 | 1 | taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous, and yet it
line = 176 | 1 | seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a
line = 177 | 1 | state of mind. She saw, I suppose, the doubt in my face, for she put the
line = 178 | 1 | rosary round my neck, and said, "For your mother's sake," and went out
line = 179 | 1 | of the room. I am writing up this part of the diary whilst I am waiting
line = 180 | 1 | for the coach, which is, of course, late; and the crucifix is still
line = 181 | 1 | round my neck. Whether it is the old lady's fear, or the many ghostly
line = 182 | 1 | traditions of this place, or the crucifix itself, I do not know, but I
line = 183 | 1 | am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual. If this book should
line = 184 | 1 | ever reach Mina before I do, let it bring my good-bye. Here comes the
line = 185 | 1 | coach!
line = 186 | 1 | 
line = 187 | 1 |        *       *       *       *       *
line = 188 | 1 | 
line = 189 | 1 | _5 May. The Castle._--The grey of the morning has passed, and the sun is
line = 190 | 1 | high over the distant horizon, which seems jagged, whether with trees or
line = 191 | 1 | hills I know not, for it is so far off that big things and little are
line = 192 | 1 | mixed. I am not sleepy, and, as I am not to be called till I awake,
line = 193 | 1 | naturally I write till sleep comes. There are many odd things to put
line = 194 | 1 | down, and, lest who reads them may fancy that I dined too well before I
line = 195 | 1 | left Bistritz, let me put down my dinner exactly. I dined on what they
line = 196 | 1 | called "robber steak"--bits of bacon, onion, and beef, seasoned with red
line = 197 | 1 | pepper, and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire, in the simple
line = 198 | 1 | style of the London cat's meat! The wine was Golden Mediasch, which
line = 199 | 1 | produces a queer sting on the tongue, which is, however, not
line = 200 | 1 | disagreeable. I had only a couple of glasses of this, and nothing else.
line = 201 | 1 | 
line = 202 | 1 | When I got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat, and I saw him
line = 203 | 1 | talking with the landlady. They were evidently talking of me, for every
line = 204 | 1 | now and then they looked at me, and some of the people who were sitting
line = 205 | 1 | on the bench outside the door--which they call by a name meaning
line = 206 | 1 | "word-bearer"--came and listened, and then looked at me, most of them
line = 207 | 1 | pityingly. I could hear a lot of words often repeated, queer words, for
line = 208 | 1 | there were many nationalities in the crowd; so I quietly got my polyglot
line = 209 | 1 | dictionary from my bag and looked them out. I must say they were not
line = 210 | 1 | cheering to me, for amongst them were "Ordog"--Satan, "pokol"--hell,
line = 211 | 1 | "stregoica"--witch, "vrolok" and "vlkoslak"--both of which mean the same
line = 212 | 1 | thing, one being Slovak and the other Servian for something that is
line = 213 | 1 | either were-wolf or vampire. (_Mem._, I must ask the Count about these
line = 214 | 1 | superstitions)
line = 215 | 1 | 
line = 216 | 1 | When we started, the crowd round the inn door, which had by this time
line = 217 | 1 | swelled to a considerable size, all made the sign of the cross and
line = 218 | 1 | pointed two fingers towards me. With some difficulty I got a
line = 219 | 1 | fellow-passenger to tell me what they meant; he would not answer at
line = 220 | 1 | first, but on learning that I was English, he explained that it was a
line = 221 | 1 | charm or guard against the evil eye. This was not very pleasant for me,
line = 222 | 1 | just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man; but every one
line = 223 | 1 | seemed so kind-hearted, and so sorrowful, and so sympathetic that I
line = 224 | 1 | could not but be touched. I shall never forget the last glimpse which I
line = 225 | 1 | had of the inn-yard and its crowd of picturesque figures, all crossing
line = 226 | 1 | themselves, as they stood round the wide archway, with its background of
line = 227 | 1 | rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the
line = 228 | 1 | centre of the yard. Then our driver, whose wide linen drawers covered
line = 229 | 1 | the whole front of the box-seat--"gotza" they call them--cracked his big
line = 230 | 1 | whip over his four small horses, which ran abreast, and we set off on
line = 231 | 1 | our journey.
line = 232 | 1 | 
line = 233 | 1 | I soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the
line = 234 | 1 | scene as we drove along, although had I known the language, or rather
line = 235 | 1 | languages, which my fellow-passengers were speaking, I might not have
line = 236 | 1 | been able to throw them off so easily. Before us lay a green sloping
line = 237 | 1 | land full of forests and woods, with here and there steep hills, crowned
line = 238 | 1 | with clumps of trees or with farmhouses, the blank gable end to the
line = 239 | 1 | road. There was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom--apple,
line = 240 | 1 | plum, pear, cherry; and as we drove by I could see the green grass under
line = 241 | 1 | the trees spangled with the fallen petals. In and out amongst these
line = 242 | 1 | green hills of what they call here the "Mittel Land" ran the road,
line = 243 | 1 | losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve, or was shut out by the
line = 244 | 1 | straggling ends of pine woods, which here and there ran down the
line = 245 | 1 | hillsides like tongues of flame. The road was rugged, but still we
line = 246 | 1 | seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste. I could not understand then
line = 247 | 1 | what the haste meant, but the driver was evidently bent on losing no
line = 248 | 1 | time in reaching Borgo Prund. I was told that this road is in summertime
line = 249 | 1 | excellent, but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter
line = 250 | 1 | snows. In this respect it is different from the general run of roads in
line = 251 | 1 | the Carpathians, for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept
line = 252 | 1 | in too good order. Of old the Hospadars would not repair them, lest the
line = 253 | 1 | Turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops,
line = 254 | 1 | and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point.
line = 255 | 1 | 
line = 256 | 1 | Beyond the green swelling hills of the Mittel Land rose mighty slopes
line = 257 | 1 | of forest up to the lofty steeps of the Carpathians themselves. Right
line = 258 | 1 | and left of us they towered, with the afternoon sun falling full upon
line = 259 | 1 | them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range,
line = 260 | 1 | deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks, green and brown where
line = 261 | 1 | grass and rock mingled, and an endless perspective of jagged rock and
line = 262 | 1 | pointed crags, till these were themselves lost in the distance, where
line = 263 | 1 | the snowy peaks rose grandly. Here and there seemed mighty rifts in the
line = 264 | 1 | mountains, through which, as the sun began to sink, we saw now and again
line = 265 | 1 | the white gleam of falling water. One of my companions touched my arm as
line = 266 | 1 | we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty, snow-covered
line = 267 | 1 | peak of a mountain, which seemed, as we wound on our serpentine way, to
line = 268 | 1 | be right before us:--
line = 269 | 1 | 
line = 270 | 1 | "Look! Isten szek!"--"God's seat!"--and he crossed himself reverently.
line = 271 | 1 | 
line = 272 | 1 | As we wound on our endless way, and the sun sank lower and lower behind
line = 273 | 1 | us, the shadows of the evening began to creep round us. This was
line = 274 | 1 | emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountain-top still held the
line = 275 | 1 | sunset, and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink. Here and there
line = 276 | 1 | we passed Cszeks and Slovaks, all in picturesque attire, but I noticed
line = 277 | 1 | that goitre was painfully prevalent. By the roadside were many crosses,
line = 278 | 1 | and as we swept by, my companions all crossed themselves. Here and there
line = 279 | 1 | was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine, who did not even
line = 280 | 1 | turn round as we approached, but seemed in the self-surrender of
line = 281 | 1 | devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world. There were
line = 282 | 1 | many things new to me: for instance, hay-ricks in the trees, and here
line = 283 | 1 | and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch, their white stems
line = 284 | 1 | shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves. Now and
line = 285 | 1 | again we passed a leiter-wagon--the ordinary peasant's cart--with its
line = 286 | 1 | long, snake-like vertebra, calculated to suit the inequalities of the
line = 287 | 1 | road. On this were sure to be seated quite a group of home-coming
line = 288 | 1 | peasants, the Cszeks with their white, and the Slovaks with their
line = 289 | 1 | coloured, sheepskins, the latter carrying lance-fashion their long
line = 290 | 1 | staves, with axe at end. As the evening fell it began to get very cold,
line = 291 | 1 | and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the
line = 292 | 1 | gloom of the trees, oak, beech, and pine, though in the valleys which
line = 293 | 1 | ran deep between the spurs of the hills, as we ascended through the
line = 294 | 1 | Pass, the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of
line = 295 | 1 | late-lying snow. Sometimes, as the road was cut through the pine woods
line = 296 | 1 | that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us, great masses of
line = 297 | 1 | greyness, which here and there bestrewed the trees, produced a
line = 298 | 1 | peculiarly weird and solemn effect, which carried on the thoughts and
line = 299 | 1 | grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening, when the falling sunset
line = 300 | 1 | threw into strange relief the ghost-like clouds which amongst the
line = 301 | 1 | Carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys. Sometimes the
line = 302 | 1 | hills were so steep that, despite our driver's haste, the horses could
line = 303 | 1 | only go slowly. I wished to get down and walk up them, as we do at home,
line = 304 | 1 | but the driver would not hear of it. "No, no," he said; "you must not
line = 305 | 1 | walk here; the dogs are too fierce"; and then he added, with what he
line = 306 | 1 | evidently meant for grim pleasantry--for he looked round to catch the
line = 307 | 1 | approving smile of the rest--"and you may have enough of such matters
line = 308 | 1 | before you go to sleep." The only stop he would make was a moment's
line = 309 | 1 | pause to light his lamps.
line = 310 | 1 | 
line = 311 | 1 | When it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the
line = 312 | 1 | passengers, and they kept speaking to him, one after the other, as
line = 313 | 1 | though urging him to further speed. He lashed the horses unmercifully
line = 314 | 1 | with his long whip, and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on
line = 315 | 1 | to further exertions. Then through the darkness I could see a sort of
line = 316 | 1 | patch of grey light ahead of us, as though there were a cleft in the
line = 317 | 1 | hills. The excitement of the passengers grew greater; the crazy coach
line = 318 | 1 | rocked on its great leather springs, and swayed like a boat tossed on a
line = 319 | 1 | stormy sea. I had to hold on. The road grew more level, and we appeared
line = 320 | 1 | to fly along. Then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each
line = 321 | 1 | side and to frown down upon us; we were entering on the Borgo Pass. One
line = 322 | 1 | by one several of the passengers offered me gifts, which they pressed
line = 323 | 1 | upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial; these were
line = 324 | 1 | certainly of an odd and varied kind, but each was given in simple good
line = 325 | 1 | faith, with a kindly word, and a blessing, and that strange mixture of
line = 326 | 1 | fear-meaning movements which I had seen outside the hotel at
line = 327 | 1 | Bistritz--the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye.
line = 328 | 1 | Then, as we flew along, the driver leaned forward, and on each side the
line = 329 | 1 | passengers, craning over the edge of the coach, peered eagerly into the
line = 330 | 1 | darkness. It was evident that something very exciting was either
line = 331 | 1 | happening or expected, but though I asked each passenger, no one would
line = 332 | 1 | give me the slightest explanation. This state of excitement kept on for
line = 333 | 1 | some little time; and at last we saw before us the Pass opening out on
line = 334 | 1 | the eastern side. There were dark, rolling clouds overhead, and in the
line = 335 | 1 | air the heavy, oppressive sense of thunder. It seemed as though the
line = 336 | 1 | mountain range had separated two atmospheres, and that now we had got
line = 337 | 1 | into the thunderous one. I was now myself looking out for the conveyance
line = 338 | 1 | which was to take me to the Count. Each moment I expected to see the
line = 339 | 1 | glare of lamps through the blackness; but all was dark. The only light
line = 340 | 1 | was the flickering rays of our own lamps, in which the steam from our
line = 341 | 1 | hard-driven horses rose in a white cloud. We could see now the sandy
line = 342 | 1 | road lying white before us, but there was on it no sign of a vehicle.
line = 343 | 1 | The passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness, which seemed to mock
line = 344 | 1 | my own disappointment. I was already thinking what I had best do, when
line = 345 | 1 | the driver, looking at his watch, said to the others something which I
line = 346 | 1 | could hardly hear, it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone; I
line = 347 | 1 | thought it was "An hour less than the time." Then turning to me, he said
line = 348 | 1 | in German worse than my own:--
line = 349 | 1 | 
line = 350 | 1 | him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score, the other
line = 351 | 1 | dogs, who had by now been lifted in the same manner, had but small prey
line = 352 | 1 | ere the whole mass had vanished.
line = 353 | 1 | 
line = 354 | 1 | With their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed, for
line = 355 | 1 | the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at
line = 356 | 1 | their prostrate foes, and turned them over and over and tossed them in
line = 357 | 1 | the air with vicious shakes. We all seemed to find our spirits rise.
line = 358 | 1 | Whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of
line = 359 | 1 | the chapel door, or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves
line = 360 | 1 | in the open I know not; but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to
line = 361 | 1 | slip from us like a robe, and the occasion of our coming lost something
line = 362 | 1 | of its grim significance, though we did not slacken a whit in our
line = 363 | 1 | resolution. We closed the outer door and barred and locked it, and
line = 364 | 1 | bringing the dogs with us, began our search of the house. We found
line = 365 | 1 | nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions, and all
line = 366 | 1 | untouched save for my own footsteps when I had made my first visit.
line = 367 | 1 | Never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness, and even when
line = 368 | 1 | we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been
line = 369 | 1 | rabbit-hunting in a summer wood.
line = 370 | 1 | 
line = 371 | 1 | The morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front.
line = 372 | 1 | Dr. Van Helsing had taken the key of the hall-door from the bunch, and
line = 373 | 1 | locked the door in orthodox fashion, putting the key into his pocket
line = 374 | 1 | when he had done.
line = 375 | 1 | 
line = 376 | 1 | "So far," he said, "our night has been eminently successful. No harm has
line = 377 | 1 | come to us such as I feared might be and yet we have ascertained how
line = 378 | 1 | many boxes are missing. More than all do I rejoice that this, our
line = 379 | 1 | first--and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous--step has been
line = 380 | 1 | accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet Madam Mina or
line = 381 | 1 | troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and
line = 382 | 1 | smells of horror which she might never forget. One lesson, too, we have
line = 383 | 1 | learned, if it be allowable to argue _a particulari_: that the brute
line = 384 | 1 | beasts which are to the Count's command are yet themselves not amenable
line = 385 | 1 | to his spiritual power; for look, these rats that would come to his
line = 386 | 1 | call, just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and
line = 387 | 1 | to that poor mother's cry, though they come to him, they run pell-mell
line = 388 | 1 | from the so little dogs of my friend Arthur. We have other matters
line = 389 | 1 | before us, other dangers, other fears; and that monster--he has not used
line = 390 | 1 | his power over the brute world for the only or the last time to-night.
line = 391 | 1 | So be it that he has gone elsewhere. Good! It has given us opportunity
line = 392 | 1 | to cry 'check' in some ways in this chess game, which we play for the
line = 393 | 1 | stake of human souls. And now let us go home. The dawn is close at hand,
line = 394 | 1 | and we have reason to be content with our first night's work. It may be
line = 395 | 1 | ordained that we have many nights and days to follow, if full of peril;
line = 396 | 1 | but we must go on, and from no danger shall we shrink."
line = 397 | 1 | 
line = 398 | 1 | The house was silent when we got back, save for some poor creature who
line = 399 | 1 | was screaming away in one of the distant wards, and a low, moaning sound
line = 400 | 1 | from Renfield's room. The poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself,
line = 401 | 1 | after the manner of the insane, with needless thoughts of pain.
line = 402 | 1 | 
line = 403 | 1 | I came tiptoe into our own room, and found Mina asleep, breathing so
line = 404 | 1 | softly that I had to put my ear down to hear it. She looks paler than
line = 405 | 1 | usual. I hope the meeting to-night has not upset her. I am truly
line = 406 | 1 | thankful that she is to be left out of our future work, and even of our
line = 407 | 1 | deliberations. It is too great a strain for a woman to bear. I did not
line = 408 | 1 | think so at first, but I know better now. Therefore I am glad that it is
line = 409 | 1 | settled. There may be things which would frighten her to hear; and yet
line = 410 | 1 | to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she
line = 411 | 1 | suspected that there was any concealment. Henceforth our work is to be a

line = 422 | 1 | overslept ourselves, for the day was a busy one, and the night had no
line = 423 | 1 | rest at all. Even Mina must have felt its exhaustion, for though I slept
line = 424 | 1 | till the sun was high, I was awake before her, and had to call two or
line = 425 | 1 | three times before she awoke. Indeed, she was so sound asleep that for a
line = 426 | 1 | few seconds she did not recognize me, but looked at me with a sort of
line = 427 | 1 | blank terror, as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream. She
line = 428 | 1 | complained a little of being tired, and I let her rest till later in the
line = 429 | 1 | day. We now know of twenty-one boxes having been removed, and if it be
line = 430 | 1 | that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace
line = 431 | 1 | them all. Such will, of course, immensely simplify our labour, and the

line = 437 | 1 | 
line = 438 | 1 | _1 October._--It was towards noon when I was awakened by the Professor
line = 439 | 1 | walking into my room. He was more jolly and cheerful than usual, and it
line = 440 | 1 | is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the
line = 441 | 1 | brooding weight off his mind. After going over the adventure of the
line = 442 | 1 | night he suddenly said:--
line = 443 | 1 | 
line = 444 | 1 | "Your patient interests me much. May it be that with you I visit him
line = 445 | 1 | this morning? Or if that you are too occupy, I can go alone if it may
line = 446 | 1 | be. It is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy,
line = 447 | 1 | and reason so sound." I had some work to do which pressed, so I told him
line = 448 | 1 | that if he would go alone I would be glad, as then I should not have to
line = 449 | 1 | keep him waiting; so I called an attendant and gave him the necessary
line = 450 | 1 | instructions. Before the Professor left the room I cautioned him against
line = 451 | 1 | getting any false impression from my patient. "But," he answered, "I
line = 452 | 1 | want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live
line = 453 | 1 | things. He said to Madam Mina, as I see in your diary of yesterday, that
line = 454 | 1 | he had once had such a belief. Why do you smile, friend John?"
line = 455 | 1 | 
line = 456 | 1 | "Excuse me," I said, "but the answer is here." I laid my hand on the
line = 457 | 1 | type-written matter. "When our sane and learned lunatic made that very
line = 458 | 1 | statement of how he _used_ to consume life, his mouth was actually
line = 459 | 1 | nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before Mrs.
line = 460 | 1 | Harker entered the room." Van Helsing smiled in turn. "Good!" he said.
line = 461 | 1 | "Your memory is true, friend John. I should have remembered. And yet it
line = 462 | 1 | is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease
line = 463 | 1 | such a fascinating study. Perhaps I may gain more knowledge out of the
line = 464 | 1 | folly of this madman than I shall from the teaching of the most wise.
line = 465 | 1 | Who knows?" I went on with my work, and before long was through that in
line = 466 | 1 | hand. It seemed that the time had been very short indeed, but there was
line = 467 | 1 | Van Helsing back in the study. "Do I interrupt?" he asked politely as he
line = 468 | 1 | stood at the door.
line = 469 | 1 | 
line = 470 | 1 | "Not at all," I answered. "Come in. My work is finished, and I am free.
line = 471 | 1 | I can go with you now, if you like.
line = 472 | 1 | 
line = 473 | 1 | "It is needless; I have seen him!"
line = 474 | 1 | 
line = 475 | 1 | "Well?"
line = 476 | 1 | 
line = 477 | 1 | "I fear that he does not appraise me at much. Our interview was short.
line = 478 | 1 | When I entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre, with
line = 479 | 1 | his elbows on his knees, and his face was the picture of sullen
line = 480 | 1 | discontent. I spoke to him as cheerfully as I could, and with such a
line = 481 | 1 | measure of respect as I could assume. He made no reply whatever. "Don't
line = 482 | 1 | you know me?" I asked. His answer was not reassuring: "I know you well
line = 483 | 1 | enough; you are the old fool Van Helsing. I wish you would take yourself
line = 484 | 1 | and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else. Damn all thick-headed
line = 485 | 1 | Dutchmen!" Not a word more would he say, but sat in his implacable
line = 486 | 1 | sullenness as indifferent to me as though I had not been in the room at
line = 487 | 1 | all. Thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so
line = 488 | 1 | clever lunatic; so I shall go, if I may, and cheer myself with a few
line = 489 | 1 | happy words with that sweet soul Madam Mina. Friend John, it does
line = 490 | 1 | rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained, no more to be
line = 491 | 1 | worried with our terrible things. Though we shall much miss her help, it
line = 492 | 1 | is better so."
line = 493 | 1 | 
line = 494 | 1 | "I agree with you with all my heart," I answered earnestly, for I did
line = 495 | 1 | not want him to weaken in this matter. "Mrs. Harker is better out of it.
line = 496 | 1 | Things are quite bad enough for us, all men of the world, and who have
line = 497 | 1 | been in many tight places in our time; but it is no place for a woman,
line = 498 | 1 | and if she had remained in touch with the affair, it would in time
line = 499 | 1 | infallibly have wrecked her."
line = 500 | 1 | 
line = 501 | 1 | So Van Helsing has gone to confer with Mrs. Harker and Harker; Quincey
line = 502 | 1 | and Art are all out following up the clues as to the earth-boxes. I
line = 503 | 1 | shall finish my round of work and we shall meet to-night.

line = 506 | 1 | _Mina Harker's Journal._
line = 507 | 1 | 
line = 508 | 1 | _1 October._--It is strange to me to be kept in the dark as I am to-day;
line = 509 | 1 | after Jonathan's full confidence for so many years, to see him
line = 510 | 1 | manifestly avoid certain matters, and those the most vital of all. This
line = 511 | 1 | morning I slept late after the fatigues of yesterday, and though
line = 512 | 1 | Jonathan was late too, he was the earlier. He spoke to me before he went
line = 513 | 1 | out, never more sweetly or tenderly, but he never mentioned a word of
line = 514 | 1 | what had happened in the visit to the Count's house. And yet he must
line = 515 | 1 | have known how terribly anxious I was. Poor dear fellow! I suppose it
line = 516 | 1 | must have distressed him even more than it did me. They all agreed that
line = 517 | 1 | it was best that I should not be drawn further into this awful work, and
line = 518 | 1 | I acquiesced. But to think that he keeps anything from me! And now I am
line = 519 | 1 | crying like a silly fool, when I _know_ it comes from my husband's great
line = 520 | 1 | love and from the good, good wishes of those other strong men.
line = 521 | 1 | 
line = 522 | 1 | That has done me good. Well, some day Jonathan will tell me all; and
line = 523 | 1 | lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that I kept
line = 524 | 1 | anything from him, I still keep my journal as usual. Then if he has
line = 525 | 1 | feared of my trust I shall show it to him, with every thought of my
line = 526 | 1 | heart put down for his dear eyes to read. I feel strangely sad and
line = 527 | 1 | low-spirited to-day. I suppose it is the reaction from the terrible
line = 528 | 1 | excitement.
line = 529 | 1 | 
line = 530 | 1 | Last night I went to bed when the men had gone, simply because they told
line = 531 | 1 | me to. I didn't feel sleepy, and I did feel full of devouring anxiety. I
line = 532 | 1 | kept thinking over everything that has been ever since Jonathan came to
line = 533 | 1 | see me in London, and it all seems like a horrible tragedy, with fate
line = 534 | 1 | pressing on relentlessly to some destined end. Everything that one does
line = 535 | 1 | seems, no matter how right it may be, to bring on the very thing which
line = 536 | 1 | is most to be deplored. If I hadn't gone to Whitby, perhaps poor dear
line = 537 | 1 | Lucy would be with us now. She hadn't taken to visiting the churchyard
line = 538 | 1 | till I came, and if she hadn't come there in the day-time with me she
line = 539 | 1 | wouldn't have walked there in her sleep; and if she hadn't gone there at
line = 540 | 1 | night and asleep, that monster couldn't have destroyed her as he did.
line = 541 | 1 | Oh, why did I ever go to Whitby? There now, crying again! I wonder what
line = 542 | 1 | has come over me to-day. I must hide it from Jonathan, for if he knew
line = 543 | 1 | that I had been crying twice in one morning--I, who never cried on my
line = 544 | 1 | own account, and whom he has never caused to shed a tear--the dear
line = 545 | 1 | fellow would fret his heart out. I shall put a bold face on, and if I do
line = 546 | 1 | feel weepy, he shall never see it. I suppose it is one of the lessons
line = 547 | 1 | that we poor women have to learn....
line = 548 | 1 | 
line = 549 | 1 | I can't quite remember how I fell asleep last night. I remember hearing
line = 550 | 1 | the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds, like praying
line = 551 | 1 | on a very tumultuous scale, from Mr. Renfield's room, which is somewhere
line = 552 | 1 | under this. And then there was silence over everything, silence so
line = 553 | 1 | profound that it startled me, and I got up and looked out of the window.
line = 554 | 1 | All was dark and silent, the black shadows thrown by the moonlight
line = 555 | 1 | seeming full of a silent mystery of their own. Not a thing seemed to be
line = 556 | 1 | stirring, but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate; so that a thin
line = 557 | 1 | streak of white mist, that crept with almost imperceptible slowness
line = 558 | 1 | across the grass towards the house, seemed to have a sentience and a
line = 559 | 1 | vitality of its own. I think that the digression of my thoughts must
line = 560 | 1 | have done me good, for when I got back to bed I found a lethargy
line = 561 | 1 | creeping over me. I lay a while, but could not quite sleep, so I got out
line = 562 | 1 | and looked out of the window again. The mist was spreading, and was now
line = 563 | 1 | close up to the house, so that I could see it lying thick against the
line = 564 | 1 | wall, as though it were stealing up to the windows. The poor man was
line = 565 | 1 | more loud than ever, and though I could not distinguish a word he said,
line = 566 | 1 | I could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on
line = 567 | 1 | his part. Then there was the sound of a struggle, and I knew that the
line = 568 | 1 | attendants were dealing with him. I was so frightened that I crept into
line = 569 | 1 | bed, and pulled the clothes over my head, putting my fingers in my ears.
line = 570 | 1 | I was not then a bit sleepy, at least so I thought; but I must have
line = 571 | 1 | fallen asleep, for, except dreams, I do not remember anything until the
line = 572 | 1 | morning, when Jonathan woke me. I think that it took me an effort and a
line = 573 | 1 | little time to realise where I was, and that it was Jonathan who was
line = 574 | 1 | bending over me. My dream was very peculiar, and was almost typical of
line = 575 | 1 | the way that waking thoughts become merged in, or continued in, dreams.
line = 576 | 1 | 
line = 577 | 1 | I thought that I was asleep, and waiting for Jonathan to come back. I
line = 578 | 1 | was very anxious about him, and I was powerless to act; my feet, and my
line = 579 | 1 | hands, and my brain were weighted, so that nothing could proceed at the
line = 580 | 1 | usual pace. And so I slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn
line = 581 | 1 | upon me that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the
line = 582 | 1 | clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was dim
line = 583 | 1 | around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, but turned down,
line = 584 | 1 | came only like a tiny red spark through the fog, which had evidently
line = 585 | 1 | grown thicker and poured into the room. Then it occurred to me that I
line = 586 | 1 | had shut the window before I had come to bed. I would have got out to
line = 587 | 1 | make certain on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my
line = 588 | 1 | limbs and even my will. I lay still and endured; that was all. I closed
line = 589 | 1 | my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It is wonderful what
line = 590 | 1 | tricks our dreams play us, and how conveniently we can imagine.) The
line = 591 | 1 | mist grew thicker and thicker and I could see now how it came in, for I
line = 592 | 1 | could see it like smoke--or with the white energy of boiling
line = 593 | 1 | water--pouring in, not through the window, but through the joinings of
line = 594 | 1 | the door. It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became
line = 595 | 1 | concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, through the top
line = 596 | 1 | of which I could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye. Things
line = 597 | 1 | began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now
line = 598 | 1 | whirling in the room, and through it all came the scriptural words "a
line = 599 | 1 | pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night." Was it indeed some such
line = 600 | 1 | spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep? But the pillar was
line = 601 | 1 | composed of both the day and the night-guiding, for the fire was in the
line = 602 | 1 | red eye, which at the thought got a new fascination for me; till, as I
line = 603 | 1 | looked, the fire divided, and seemed to shine on me through the fog like
line = 604 | 1 | two red eyes, such as Lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering
line = 605 | 1 | when, on the cliff, the dying sunlight struck the windows of St. Mary's
line = 606 | 1 | Church. Suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that Jonathan
line = 607 | 1 | had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist
line = 608 | 1 | in the moonlight, and in my dream I must have fainted, for all became
line = 609 | 1 | black darkness. The last conscious effort which imagination made was to
line = 610 | 1 | show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist. I must be
line = 611 | 1 | careful of such dreams, for they would unseat one's reason if there were
line = 612 | 1 | too much of them. I would get Dr. Van Helsing or Dr. Seward to prescribe
line = 613 | 1 | something for me which would make me sleep, only that I fear to alarm
line = 614 | 1 | them. Such a dream at the present time would become woven into their
line = 615 | 1 | fears for me. To-night I shall strive hard to sleep naturally. If I do
line = 616 | 1 | not, I shall to-morrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral; that
line = 617 | 1 | cannot hurt me for once, and it will give me a good night's sleep. Last
line = 618 | 1 | night tired me more than if I had not slept at all.

line = 622 | 1 | _2 October 10 p. m._--Last night I slept, but did not dream. I must have
line = 623 | 1 | slept soundly, for I was not waked by Jonathan coming to bed; but the
line = 624 | 1 | sleep has not refreshed me, for to-day I feel terribly weak and
line = 625 | 1 | spiritless. I spent all yesterday trying to read, or lying down dozing.
line = 626 | 1 | In the afternoon Mr. Renfield asked if he might see me. Poor man, he was
line = 627 | 1 | very gentle, and when I came away he kissed my hand and bade God bless
line = 628 | 1 | me. Some way it affected me much; I am crying when I think of him. This
line = 629 | 1 | is a new weakness, of which I must be careful. Jonathan would be
line = 630 | 1 | miserable if he knew I had been crying. He and the others were out till
line = 631 | 1 | dinner-time, and they all came in tired. I did what I could to brighten
line = 632 | 1 | them up, and I suppose that the effort did me good, for I forgot how
line = 633 | 1 | tired I was. After dinner they sent me to bed, and all went off to smoke
line = 634 | 1 | together, as they said, but I knew that they wanted to tell each other
line = 635 | 1 | of what had occurred to each during the day; I could see from Jonathan's
line = 636 | 1 | manner that he had something important to communicate. I was not so
line = 637 | 1 | sleepy as I should have been; so before they went I asked Dr. Seward to
line = 638 | 1 | give me a little opiate of some kind, as I had not slept well the night
line = 639 | 1 | before. He very kindly made me up a sleeping draught, which he gave to
line = 640 | 1 | me, telling me that it would do me no harm, as it was very mild.... I
line = 641 | 1 | have taken it, and am waiting for sleep, which still keeps aloof. I hope
line = 642 | 1 | I have not done wrong, for as sleep begins to flirt with me, a new fear
line = 643 | 1 | comes: that I may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the
line = 644 | 1 | power of waking. I might want it. Here comes sleep. Good-night.

line = 652 | 1 | 
line = 653 | 1 | 
line = 654 | 1 | _1 October, evening._--I found Thomas Snelling in his house at Bethnal
line = 655 | 1 | Green, but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything. The
line = 656 | 1 | very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had
line = 657 | 1 | proved too much, and he had begun too early on his expected debauch. I
line = 658 | 1 | learned, however, from his wife, who seemed a decent, poor soul, that he
line = 659 | 1 | was only the assistant to Smollet, who of the two mates was the
line = 660 | 1 | responsible person. So off I drove to Walworth, and found Mr. Joseph
line = 661 | 1 | Smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves, taking a late tea out of a
line = 662 | 1 | saucer. He is a decent, intelligent fellow, distinctly a good, reliable
line = 663 | 1 | type of workman, and with a headpiece of his own. He remembered all
line = 664 | 1 | about the incident of the boxes, and from a wonderful dog's-eared
line = 665 | 1 | notebook, which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the
line = 666 | 1 | seat of his trousers, and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick,
line = 667 | 1 | half-obliterated pencil, he gave me the destinations of the boxes. There
line = 668 | 1 | were, he said, six in the cartload which he took from Carfax and left at
line = 669 | 1 | 197, Chicksand Street, Mile End New Town, and another six which he
line = 670 | 1 | deposited at Jamaica Lane, Bermondsey. If then the Count meant to
line = 671 | 1 | scatter these ghastly refuges of his over London, these places were
line = 672 | 1 | chosen as the first of delivery, so that later he might distribute more
line = 673 | 1 | fully. The systematic manner in which this was done made me think that
line = 674 | 1 | he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of London. He was now
line = 675 | 1 | fixed on the far east of the northern shore, on the east of the southern
line = 676 | 1 | shore, and on the south. The north and west were surely never meant to
line = 677 | 1 | be left out of his diabolical scheme--let alone the City itself and the
line = 678 | 1 | very heart of fashionable London in the south-west and west. I went back
line = 679 | 1 | to Smollet, and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had
line = 680 | 1 | been taken from Carfax.
line = 681 | 1 | 
line = 682 | 1 | He replied:--
line = 683 | 1 | 
line = 684 | 1 | "Well, guv'nor, you've treated me wery 'an'some"--I had given him half a
line = 685 | 1 | sovereign--"an' I'll tell yer all I know. I heard a man by the name of
line = 686 | 1 | Bloxam say four nights ago in the 'Are an' 'Ounds, in Pincher's Alley,
line = 687 | 1 | as 'ow he an' his mate 'ad 'ad a rare dusty job in a old 'ouse at
line = 688 | 1 | Purfect. There ain't a-many such jobs as this 'ere, an' I'm thinkin'
line = 689 | 1 | that maybe Sam Bloxam could tell ye summut." I asked if he could tell me
line = 690 | 1 | where to find him. I told him that if he could get me the address it
line = 691 | 1 | would be worth another half-sovereign to him. So he gulped down the rest
line = 692 | 1 | of his tea and stood up, saying that he was going to begin the search
line = 693 | 1 | then and there. At the door he stopped, and said:--
line = 694 | 1 | 
line = 695 | 1 | "Look 'ere, guv'nor, there ain't no sense in me a-keepin' you 'ere. I
line = 696 | 1 | may find Sam soon, or I mayn't; but anyhow he ain't like to be in a way
line = 697 | 1 | to tell ye much to-night. Sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze.
line = 698 | 1 | If you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it, and put yer address on
line = 699 | 1 | it, I'll find out where Sam is to be found and post it ye to-night. But
line = 700 | 1 | ye'd better be up arter 'im soon in the mornin', or maybe ye won't ketch
line = 701 | 1 | 'im; for Sam gets off main early, never mind the booze the night afore."
line = 702 | 1 | 
line = 703 | 1 | This was all practical, so one of the children went off with a penny to
line = 704 | 1 | buy an envelope and a sheet of paper, and to keep the change. When she
line = 705 | 1 | came back, I addressed the envelope and stamped it, and when Smollet had
line = 706 | 1 | again faithfully promised to post the address when found, I took my way
line = 707 | 1 | to home. We're on the track anyhow. I am tired to-night, and want sleep.
line = 708 | 1 | Mina is fast asleep, and looks a little too pale; her eyes look as
line = 709 | 1 | though she had been crying. Poor dear, I've no doubt it frets her to be
line = 710 | 1 | kept in the dark, and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the
line = 711 | 1 | others. But it is best as it is. It is better to be disappointed and
line = 712 | 1 | worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken. The doctors
line = 713 | 1 | were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful
line = 714 | 1 | business. I must be firm, for on me this particular burden of silence
line = 715 | 1 | must rest. I shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any
line = 716 | 1 | circumstances. Indeed, it may not be a hard task, after all, for she
line = 717 | 1 | herself has become reticent on the subject, and has not spoken of the
line = 718 | 1 | Count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision.
